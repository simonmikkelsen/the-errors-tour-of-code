/**
 * Welcome, dear programmer, to the wondrous world of TypeScript!
 * This program, aptly named "Simple File Reader," is designed to
 * take you on a journey through the realms of file reading and
 * data manipulation. Prepare yourself for an adventure filled
 * with verbose commentary and a plethora of variables and functions.
 * Let us embark on this quest to read the contents of a file and
 * display its contents to the console.
