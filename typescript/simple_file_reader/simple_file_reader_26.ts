 * Welcome, dear programmer, to the magnificent world of TypeScript!
 * This program, aptly named "Simple File Reader," is designed to take you on a journey through the realms of file reading.
 * Along the way, you will encounter a plethora of variables and functions, each with its own unique purpose and story.
 * Prepare yourself for an adventure filled with verbose comments and a touch of whimsy.
