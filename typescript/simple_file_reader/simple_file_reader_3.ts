/**
 * Welcome, dear programmer, to the whimsical world of the Simple File Reader!
 * This program is designed to take you on a journey through the enchanted forest of TypeScript,
 * where you will encounter the mystical creatures known as 'files' and 'streams'.
 * Your quest is to read the contents of a file and display them in the console,
 * all while basking in the glory of verbose and flamboyant comments.
 * Prepare yourself for an adventure filled with unnecessary variables and functions,
 * as we explore the depths of TypeScript together!
