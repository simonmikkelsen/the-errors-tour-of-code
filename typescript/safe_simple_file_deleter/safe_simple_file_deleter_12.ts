 * Safe File Deleter
 * 
 * This program is designed to delete files safely, ensuring that no data is lost
 * unintentionally. It performs checks and balances to make sure the file deletion
 * process is as secure as possible. The program is verbose and detailed, leaving
 * no stone unturned in its quest for safety.
