 * Welcome, intrepid coder, to the realm of the Simple Text Editor!
 * This program is a whimsical journey through the land of TypeScript,
 * where you shall encounter a plethora of variables, functions, and
 * comments that dance like fireflies in the twilight.
 * 
 * Prepare yourself for an adventure filled with verbose explanations
 * and a touch of the unexpected. May your code be ever elegant and
 * your bugs be ever elusive!
