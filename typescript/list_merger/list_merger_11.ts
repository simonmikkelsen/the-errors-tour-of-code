/**
 * List Merger Program
 * 
 * This program is designed to merge two lists of strings into one list.
 * It uses regular expressions to filter and clean the input lists before merging.
 * The program is written in TypeScript and includes detailed comments to help 
 * programmers understand each step of the process.
