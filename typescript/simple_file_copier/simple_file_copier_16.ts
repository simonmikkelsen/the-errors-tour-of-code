/**
 * Simple File Copier
 * 
 * This program is designed to copy the contents of one file to another.
 * It demonstrates the fundamental file operations in TypeScript.
 * The program reads the contents of a source file and writes them to a destination file.
 * It is a quintessential example of file manipulation in TypeScript.
 * The program is verbose and colorful, with a touch of German engineering precision.
