/**
 * This program is designed to copy the contents of one file to another.
 * It is a simple file copier that demonstrates basic file operations in TypeScript.
 * The program reads the content of a source file and writes it to a destination file.
 * This is a fundamental exercise for understanding file I/O operations.
 * The program is verbose and includes many comments to guide the reader.
