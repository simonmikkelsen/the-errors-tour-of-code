 * Welcome, dear programmer, to the realm of the Simple File Writer!
 * This program is a delightful journey through the art of writing to files using TypeScript.
 * Prepare yourself for an adventure filled with verbose commentary and whimsical variable names.
 * Let us embark on this quest to master the arcane art of file manipulation!
