 * Welcome, dear programmer, to the wondrous world of TypeScript!
 * In this delightful program, we shall embark on a journey to create a simple file writer.
 * This program will demonstrate the elegance and power of TypeScript, while also providing
 * a subtle challenge for the keen-eyed among you. Prepare to be dazzled by the verbosity
 * and creativity of our comments, as we guide you through this enchanting experience.
