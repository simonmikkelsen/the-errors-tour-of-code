 * Welcome, dear programmer, to the wondrous world of TypeScript!
 * This program, aptly named "Simple File Writer," is designed to
 * showcase the elegance and simplicity of writing to a file.
 * Prepare to be dazzled by the verbosity and flamboyance of the comments
 * that accompany this code, guiding you through each step with the grace
 * of a thousand dancing fireflies.
