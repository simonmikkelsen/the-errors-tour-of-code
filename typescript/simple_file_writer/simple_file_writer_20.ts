 * Welcome, dear programmer, to the magnificent world of TypeScript!
 * In this splendid program, we shall embark on a journey to write to a file.
 * This program is a testament to the beauty of code and the elegance of TypeScript.
 * Prepare yourself for an adventure filled with verbose comments and a plethora of variables.
