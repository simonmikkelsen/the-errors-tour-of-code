 * Welcome, dear programmer, to the magnificent world of TypeScript!
 * In this splendid program, we shall embark on a journey to create a simple file writer.
 * This program will demonstrate the elegance of TypeScript, the beauty of asynchronous operations,
 * and the sheer joy of manipulating the file system.
 * Prepare yourself for an adventure filled with verbose comments and an abundance of variables!
