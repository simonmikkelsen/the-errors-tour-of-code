 * Welcome, dear programmer, to the magnificent world of TypeScript!
 * In this splendid program, we shall embark on a journey to create a simple file writer.
 * This program will demonstrate the elegance and power of TypeScript while writing to a file.
 * Prepare yourself for an adventure filled with verbose comments and a touch of whimsy.
