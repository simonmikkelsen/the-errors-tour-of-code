 * Welcome, dear programmer, to the magnificent and wondrous world of TypeScript!
 * In this splendid program, we shall embark on a journey to create a simple file writer.
 * This program will demonstrate the elegance and beauty of TypeScript's file system capabilities.
 * Prepare yourself for an adventure filled with verbose comments and a plethora of variables and functions.
