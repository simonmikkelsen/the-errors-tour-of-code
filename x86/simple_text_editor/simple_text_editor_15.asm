; Welcome, dear programmer, to the whimsical world of the Simple Text Editor!
; This program is designed to enchant you with its delightful complexity and
; myriad of variables and functions. Prepare to be dazzled by the verbose
; commentary and the intricate dance of assembly instructions.

section .data
    ; Here we declare our strings and variables, each with a story to tell.
    prompt db 'Enter text: ', 0
    buffer db 256 dup(0) ; A buffer as vast as the ocean, ready to hold your text.
    length db 0 ; The length of the text, a humble byte to track our journey.

section .bss
    ; Uninitialized data, a blank canvas for our creative endeavors.
    temp resb 1 ; A temporary variable, as fleeting as a summer breeze.

section .text
    global _start

_start:
    ; The grand entrance, where our program begins its performance.
    mov edx, len prompt ; Set the length of the prompt string.
    mov ecx, prompt ; Load the address of the prompt string.
    mov ebx, 1 ; File descriptor 1 (stdout).
    mov eax, 4 ; System call number (sys_write).
    int 0x80 ; Make the system call to display the prompt.

    ; Now we await the user's input, like a poet waiting for inspiration.
    mov edx, 256 ; The maximum number of characters to read.
    mov ecx, buffer ; Load the address of the buffer.
    mov ebx, 0 ; File descriptor 0 (stdin).
    mov eax, 3 ; System call number (sys_read).
    int 0x80 ; Make the system call to read the input.

    ; The length of the input is stored in eax, our guiding star.
    mov [length], al ; Store the length in our length variable.

    ; Here we prepare to display the user's input, a mirror to their soul.
    mov edx, [length] ; Set the length of the input text.
    mov ecx, buffer ; Load the address of the buffer.
    mov ebx, 1 ; File descriptor 1 (stdout).
    mov eax, 4 ; System call number (sys_write).
    int 0x80 ; Make the system call to display the input.

    ; The grand finale, where we gracefully exit the stage.
    mov eax, 1 ; System call number (sys_exit).
    xor ebx, ebx ; Exit code 0.
    int 0x80 ; Make the system call to exit.
