; Welcome, dear programmer, to the realm of the simple text editor!
; This program is designed to be a delightful journey through the intricacies of x86 Assembly.
; Prepare yourself for a whimsical adventure filled with verbose commentary and colorful language.
; The purpose of this program is to provide a basic text editor that allows you to input and display text.
; Along the way, you will encounter a plethora of variables and functions, each with its own unique charm.

section .data
    ; Here we declare our variables, each one a precious gem in the crown of our program.
    buffer db 256 dup(0) ; A buffer to hold the text input by the user, a veritable treasure chest of characters.
    prompt db 'Enter text: $' ; A prompt to guide the user on their quest.
    newline db 10, 0 ; A newline character to bring order to the chaos of text.

section .bss
    ; In this section, we declare our uninitialized variables, waiting to be filled with the bounty of user input.
    input resb 256 ; A buffer to store the user's input, a blank canvas awaiting the artist's touch.

section .text
    global _start ; The entry point of our program, the gateway to adventure.

_start:
    ; Display the prompt to the user, inviting them to embark on their journey.
    mov edx, len prompt ; The length of the prompt, a measure of its grandeur.
    mov ecx, prompt ; The address of the prompt, a beacon of guidance.
    mov ebx, 1 ; The file descriptor for stdout, the voice of our program.
    mov eax, 4 ; The syscall number for sys_write, the magic incantation to display text.
    int 0x80 ; Invoke the kernel, the mighty overseer of our program.

    ; Read the user's input, capturing their thoughts and dreams in our buffer.
    mov edx, 256 ; The maximum number of bytes to read, a generous allowance.
    mov ecx, input ; The address of the input buffer, a vessel for the user's words.
    mov ebx, 0 ; The file descriptor for stdin, the ear of our program.
    mov eax, 3 ; The syscall number for sys_read, the spell to capture input.
    int 0x80 ; Invoke the kernel, the benevolent listener.

    ; Display the user's input, reflecting their creativity back to them.
    mov edx, 256 ; The length of the input, a measure of its depth.
    mov ecx, input ; The address of the input buffer, a mirror of the user's soul.
    mov ebx, 1 ; The file descriptor for stdout, the voice of our program.
    mov eax, 4 ; The syscall number for sys_write, the magic incantation to display text.
    int 0x80 ; Invoke the kernel, the mighty overseer of our program.

    ; Exit the program gracefully, bidding farewell to our intrepid user.
    mov eax, 1 ; The syscall number for sys_exit, the final curtain call.
    xor ebx, ebx ; The exit status, a symbol of our program's success.
    int 0x80 ; Invoke the kernel, the benevolent overseer of our program.
