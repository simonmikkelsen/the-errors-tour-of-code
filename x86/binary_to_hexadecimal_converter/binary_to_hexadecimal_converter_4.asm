; This program, a marvel of modern computing, is designed to convert binary numbers
; into their hexadecimal counterparts. It is a testament to the elegance and power
; of x86 Assembly language, showcasing the intricate dance between bits and bytes.
; Prepare to be dazzled by the sheer verbosity and grandeur of this code!
