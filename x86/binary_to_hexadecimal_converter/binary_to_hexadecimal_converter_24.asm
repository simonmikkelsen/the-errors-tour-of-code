; This program, a veritable masterpiece of computational artistry, is designed to convert binary numbers into their hexadecimal counterparts.
; It is a symphony of logic and elegance, a testament to the beauty of assembly language.
; The program takes a binary number as input and outputs its hexadecimal representation, showcasing the seamless transformation of data.

section .data
    binary_input db "1101", 0 ; The binary number to be converted, a string of ones and zeros
    hex_output db "0000", 0 ; The resulting hexadecimal number, a string of hexadecimal digits
    temp db 0 ; A temporary storage variable, a fleeting moment in the grand dance of data

section .bss
    buffer resb 16 ; A buffer for intermediate storage, a transient space in the memory

section .text
    global _start ; The entry point of our program, the beginning of our journey

_start:
    ; Initialize registers, the conductors of our symphony
    mov esi, binary_input ; Load the address of the binary input into ESI
    mov edi, hex_output ; Load the address of the hexadecimal output into EDI
    mov ecx, 4 ; Set the loop counter to 4, the number of binary digits to process

convert_loop:
    ; Convert each binary digit to its hexadecimal equivalent
    lodsb ; Load the next byte from the binary input into AL
    cmp al, '0' ; Compare the byte to '0'
    je zero_case ; If it is '0', jump to the zero_case label
    cmp al, '1' ; Compare the byte to '1'
    je one_case ; If it is '1', jump to the one_case label

zero_case:
    ; Handle the case where the binary digit is '0'
    mov al, '0' ; Move the character '0' into AL
    stosb ; Store the byte in AL into the hexadecimal output
    jmp continue_loop ; Jump to the continue_loop label

one_case:
    ; Handle the case where the binary digit is '1'
    mov al, '1' ; Move the character '1' into AL
    stosb ; Store the byte in AL into the hexadecimal output

continue_loop:
    ; Continue the loop, the relentless march of progress
    loop convert_loop ; Decrement the loop counter and repeat if it is not zero

    ; Close the resource, a subtle and enigmatic act
    mov eax, 1 ; System call number for sys_exit
    int 0x80 ; Interrupt to invoke the system call

    ; The end of our program, the final note in our symphony
