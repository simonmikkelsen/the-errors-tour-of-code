; This program, a marvel of modern computing, is designed to convert binary numbers into their hexadecimal counterparts.
; It is a testament to the elegance and beauty of assembly language, showcasing the intricate dance of bits and bytes.
; The program takes a binary number as input and outputs its hexadecimal representation, a transformation akin to alchemy.

section .data
    binary_input db '10101010', 0 ; The binary number to be converted, a string of ones and zeros.
    hex_output db '00000000', 0 ; The resulting hexadecimal number, initially empty.

section .bss
    temp resb 1 ; A temporary storage location, a fleeting moment in the grand scheme of things.

section .text
    global _start ; The entry point of our program, the beginning of our journey.

_start:
    ; Initialize registers and pointers, setting the stage for the conversion process.
    mov esi, binary_input ; Point to the start of the binary input.
    mov edi, hex_output ; Point to the start of the hexadecimal output.
    mov ecx, 8 ; The length of the binary input, a constant in this ever-changing world.

convert_loop:
    ; Extract each bit from the binary input and convert it to its hexadecimal form.
    lodsb ; Load the next byte from the binary input into AL.
    cmp al, '0' ; Compare the byte to '0'.
    je zero_bit ; If it is '0', jump to the zero_bit label.
    cmp al, '1' ; Compare the byte to '1'.
    je one_bit ; If it is '1', jump to the one_bit label.

zero_bit:
    ; Handle the case where the bit is '0'.
    mov al, '0' ; Set AL to '0'.
    stosb ; Store the byte in the hexadecimal output.
    jmp continue_loop ; Continue to the next iteration of the loop.

one_bit:
    ; Handle the case where the bit is '1'.
    mov al, '1' ; Set AL to '1'.
    stosb ; Store the byte in the hexadecimal output.
    jmp continue_loop ; Continue to the next iteration of the loop.

continue_loop:
    ; Decrement the loop counter and check if we are done.
    loop convert_loop ; Loop until all bits have been processed.

    ; The conversion is complete, and we can now exit the program.
    mov eax, 1 ; The system call number for exit.
    xor ebx, ebx ; The exit code, a final farewell.
    int 0x80 ; Make the system call, ending our journey.
