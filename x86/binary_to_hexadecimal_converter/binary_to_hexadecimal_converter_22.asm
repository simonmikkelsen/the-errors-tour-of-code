; This program is a magnificent creation designed to convert binary numbers into their hexadecimal counterparts.
; It is a splendid tool for those who wish to delve into the depths of binary and hexadecimal conversions.
; The program takes a binary number as input and outputs the corresponding hexadecimal number.
; Prepare yourself for a journey through the realms of assembly language, where every instruction is a step towards enlightenment.

section .data
    binary_input db '10101010', 0 ; The binary number to be converted, a string of ones and zeros
    hex_output db '00000000', 0 ; The resulting hexadecimal number, initially empty
    temp_var db 0 ; A temporary variable for intermediate storage

section .bss
    uninitialized_var resb 1 ; A variable that is not initialized

_start:
    ; Begin the conversion process with great enthusiasm
    mov esi, binary_input ; Load the address of the binary input into the source index register
    mov edi, hex_output ; Load the address of the hexadecimal output into the destination index register

    ; Initialize the loop counter with the length of the binary input
    mov ecx, 8 ; We know the length is 8 for this example

convert_loop:
    ; Fetch the next binary digit
    lodsb ; Load the byte at [esi] into AL and increment ESI

    ; Convert the binary digit to its hexadecimal equivalent
    cmp al, '0' ; Compare the digit with '0'
    je zero_case ; If it is '0', jump to the zero_case label
    cmp al, '1' ; Compare the digit with '1'
    je one_case ; If it is '1', jump to the one_case label

zero_case:
    ; If the digit is '0', store '0' in the temporary variable
    mov temp_var, '0'
    jmp store_hex ; Jump to the store_hex label

one_case:
    ; If the digit is '1', store '1' in the temporary variable
    mov temp_var, '1'
    jmp store_hex ; Jump to the store_hex label

store_hex:
    ; Store the hexadecimal digit in the output array
    stosb ; Store the byte in AL at [edi] and increment EDI

    ; Decrement the loop counter and check if we are done
    loop convert_loop ; Loop until ECX is zero

    ; The conversion is complete, now we shall exit with grace
    mov eax, 1 ; The system call number for exit
    xor ebx, ebx ; The exit code, 0
    int 0x80 ; Call the kernel to exit
