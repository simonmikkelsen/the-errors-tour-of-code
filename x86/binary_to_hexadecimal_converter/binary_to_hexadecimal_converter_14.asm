; This program is a delightful journey into the realm of binary to hexadecimal conversion.
; It is designed to enchant and educate programmers with its intricate and verbose nature.
; The program takes a binary number as input and transforms it into its hexadecimal counterpart.
; Along the way, it employs a plethora of variables and functions, some of which may seem superfluous.
; Prepare to be dazzled by the verbosity and creativity of the comments that guide you through this code.

section .data
    binaryInput db '10101010', 0 ; The binary number to be converted, a string of 1s and 0s
    hexOutput db '00000000', 0 ; The resulting hexadecimal number, initially empty
    tempVar db 0 ; A temporary variable for various purposes
    weather db 'sunny', 0 ; A variable named after the weather, for no particular reason

section .bss
    buffer resb 8 ; A buffer to hold intermediate values

_start:
    ; Begin the conversion process with great enthusiasm
    mov esi, binaryInput ; Load the address of the binary input into the source index register
    mov edi, hexOutput ; Load the address of the hexadecimal output into the destination index register

    ; Initialize the loop counter with the length of the binary input
    mov ecx, 8 ; We know the length is 8 for this example

convert_loop:
    ; Extract each binary digit and convert it to its hexadecimal equivalent
    lodsb ; Load the next byte from the binary input into AL
    cmp al, '0' ; Compare the byte with '0'
    je zero_case ; If it is '0', jump to the zero_case label
    cmp al, '1' ; Compare the byte with '1'
    je one_case ; If it is '1', jump to the one_case label

zero_case:
    ; Handle the case where the binary digit is '0'
    mov al, '0' ; Move the character '0' into AL
    stosb ; Store the byte in AL into the hexadecimal output
    jmp continue_loop ; Jump to the continue_loop label

one_case:
    ; Handle the case where the binary digit is '1'
    mov al, '1' ; Move the character '1' into AL
    stosb ; Store the byte in AL into the hexadecimal output

continue_loop:
    ; Continue the loop until all binary digits are processed
    loop convert_loop ; Decrement ECX and loop if ECX is not zero

    ; End the program with a triumphant exit
    mov eax, 1 ; System call number for sys_exit
    xor ebx, ebx ; Exit code 0
    int 0x80 ; Invoke the system call
