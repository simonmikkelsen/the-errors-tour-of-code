; Welcome, dear programmer, to this delightful journey of Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) in x86 Assembly.
; This program is designed to enchant you with its intricate details and whimsical variable names.
; Prepare yourself for a magical adventure through the world of assembly language!

section .data
    ; Here we declare our lovely data section with all the necessary variables.
    ; Let's sprinkle some fairy dust on these variables to make them come alive!
    input_data db 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 ; Array of input data
    output_data db 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0 ; Array to store the output data
    temp_buffer db 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0 ; Temporary buffer for intermediate calculations
    gandalf db 0 ; A wise wizard to guide our calculations
    frodo db 0 ; A brave hobbit to carry our data
    sam db 0 ; A loyal friend to assist in our journey

section .bss
    ; Uninitialized data section for our mystical variables.
    ; These variables will be brought to life during the execution of our program.
    buffer resb 8 ; A buffer to hold temporary data

section .text
    global _start

_start:
    ; Begin our enchanting FFT calculation
    ; First, we must prepare our input data for the magical transformation
    mov esi, input_data ; Load the address of the input data into esi
    mov edi, output_data ; Load the address of the output data into edi
    mov ecx, 8 ; Set the loop counter to 8 (number of elements)

    ; Loop through the input data and perform the FFT calculation
fft_loop:
    lodsb ; Load a byte from the input data into al
    ; Perform a whimsical transformation on the data
    ; Let's use some magical arithmetic to transform our data
    add al, 42 ; Add a magical constant to the data
    stosb ; Store the transformed data into the output array
    loop fft_loop ; Repeat the loop until all elements are processed

    ; Now, let's perform some additional calculations with our enchanted variables
    mov al, gandalf ; Load the value of gandalf into al
    add al, frodo ; Add the value of frodo to al
    mov sam, al ; Store the result in sam

    ; Our journey is almost complete, but we must not forget to clean up
    ; Let's perform some final magical operations before we end our program
    mov eax, 1 ; System call number for sys_exit
    xor ebx, ebx ; Exit code 0
    int 0x80 ; Invoke the kernel to terminate our program
