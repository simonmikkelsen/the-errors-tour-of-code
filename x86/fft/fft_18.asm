; Welcome, dear programmer, to this delightful journey of Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) in x86 Assembly.
; This program is designed to enchant you with the beauty of signal processing.
; It will take you through the magical world of complex numbers and their transformations.
; Prepare yourself for an adventure filled with intricate details and charming variables.

section .bss
