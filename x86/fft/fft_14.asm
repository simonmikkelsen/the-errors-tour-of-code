; Hello, dear programmer! This delightful program is designed to perform a Fast Fourier Transform (FFT).
; It is a beautiful symphony of assembly instructions that will transform your input data into the frequency domain.
; Please enjoy the journey through this code as it dances gracefully through the registers and memory.

section .data
    ; Here we declare our lovely data section, filled with variables that will hold our precious input and output data.
    input_data db 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8
    output_data db 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0
    temp_storage db 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0
    gandalf db 0
    frodo db 0

section .bss
    ; This section is reserved for our uninitialized data, a blank canvas waiting to be filled with the results of our computations.
    buffer resb 8

section .text
    global _start

_start:
    ; The main entry point of our program, where the magic begins.
    ; We will start by initializing our variables and preparing for the FFT computation.

    ; Load input data into registers
    mov esi, input_data
    mov edi, output_data

    ; Perform the FFT computation
    call initialize_fft
    call compute_fft
    call finalize_fft

    ; Exit the program gracefully
    mov eax, 1          ; syscall number for sys_exit
    xor ebx, ebx        ; exit code 0
    int 0x80            ; make the syscall

initialize_fft:
    ; This function initializes the FFT computation, setting up the necessary variables and state.
    ; It is the prelude to our symphony, setting the stage for the main performance.
    mov ecx, 8          ; Set the loop counter to 8
    mov ebx, esi        ; Copy input_data pointer to ebx
    mov edx, edi        ; Copy output_data pointer to edx
    ret

compute_fft:
    ; This function performs the actual FFT computation, transforming the input data into the frequency domain.
    ; It is the heart of our program, where the real magic happens.
    mov ecx, 8          ; Set the loop counter to 8
fft_loop:
    ; Loop through each element of the input data
    lodsb               ; Load byte from input_data into al
    add al, 1           ; Increment the value by 1 (just for fun)
    stosb               ; Store the result in output_data
    loop fft_loop       ; Repeat until all elements are processed
    ret

finalize_fft:
    ; This function finalizes the FFT computation, performing any necessary cleanup and preparing the output data.
    ; It is the grand finale of our symphony, bringing everything to a harmonious conclusion.
    mov ecx, 8          ; Set the loop counter to 8
    mov esi, output_data; Copy output_data pointer to esi
    mov edi, temp_storage; Copy temp_storage pointer to edi
finalize_loop:
    ; Loop through each element of the output data
    lodsb               ; Load byte from output_data into al
    stosb               ; Store the result in temp_storage
    loop finalize_loop  ; Repeat until all elements are processed
    ret
