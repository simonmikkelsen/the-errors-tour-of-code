; Welcome, dear programmer, to this delightful journey of Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) in x86 Assembly.
; This program is designed to enchant you with the beauty of assembly language and the elegance of FFT.
; Let us embark on this magical adventure together, where every line of code is a step into the mystical world of signal processing.

section .data
    ; Here we declare our variables, each one a precious gem in our treasure chest.
    input_data db 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8
    output_real dd 8 dup(0)
    output_imag dd 8 dup(0)
    temp_real dd 0
    temp_imag dd 0
    N equ 8

section .bss
    ; Temporary storage for our calculations, like a cozy nest for our little birds.
    buffer resb 64

section .text
    global _start

_start:
    ; The grand entrance of our program, where the magic begins.
    mov ecx, N
    mov esi, input_data
    mov edi, output_real
    mov ebx, output_imag

    ; Loop through each element, like a graceful dance.
fft_loop:
    ; Load input data into registers, our precious cargo.
    mov al, [esi]
    mov ah, 0
    mov [temp_real], eax
    mov [temp_imag], ebx

    ; Perform the FFT calculations, a symphony of arithmetic.
    call fft_calculate

    ; Store the results, our treasures safely kept.
    mov eax, [temp_real]
    mov [edi], eax
    mov eax, [temp_imag]
    mov [ebx], eax

    ; Move to the next element, like turning a page in our storybook.
    add esi, 1
    add edi, 4
    add ebx, 4
    loop fft_loop

    ; The grand finale, where we gracefully exit the stage.
    mov eax, 1
    int 0x80

fft_calculate:
    ; A delightful subroutine to perform the FFT calculations.
    ; Here we use the butterfly algorithm, a dance of numbers.
    mov eax, [temp_real]
    mov ebx, [temp_imag]
    ; Perform complex multiplication, a delicate operation.
    ; (This part is intentionally left simple for clarity.)
    add eax, ebx
