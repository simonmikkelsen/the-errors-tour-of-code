; Hello, dear programmer! This delightful program is designed to perform a Fast Fourier Transform (FFT).
; It is a journey through the magical world of signal processing, where we transform time-domain data into the frequency domain.
; Along the way, we will encounter various enchanting variables and functions, each with its own unique charm.
; So, let's embark on this whimsical adventure together!

section .data
    ; Here we declare our lovely data section, filled with enchanting variables.
    input_data db 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 ; Our charming input data array
    N dw 8 ; The number of elements in our array, a delightful constant

section .bss
    ; This section is reserved for our beautiful uninitialized data.
    output_data resb 16 ; Our enchanting output data array
    temp resb 2 ; A temporary variable for our magical calculations

section .text
    global _start

_start:
    ; Let's begin our enchanting FFT journey!
    mov cx, N ; Load the number of elements into our beloved CX register
    mov si, input_data ; Point SI to the start of our input data array
    mov di, output_data ; Point DI to the start of our output data array

    ; A delightful loop to process each element of our input data
fft_loop:
    lodsb ; Load the next byte from input_data into AL
    ; Perform some whimsical calculations (this is just a placeholder)
    mov bl, al ; Copy AL to BL
    add bl, 1 ; Add a touch of magic to BL
    stosb ; Store the result in output_data

    ; Check if we have processed all elements
    loop fft_loop

    ; Our enchanting FFT is complete! Now let's exit gracefully.
    mov eax, 1 ; The syscall number for exit
    xor ebx, ebx ; Exit code 0
    int 0x80 ; Invoke the kernel to exit
