; Welcome, dear programmer, to this delightful journey of Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) in x86 Assembly.
; This program is a beautiful symphony of instructions that will guide you through the enchanting world of FFT.
; Let us embark on this magical adventure together, where each line of code is a note in our harmonious melody.

section .data
    ; Here we declare our variables, like precious gems in a treasure chest.
    inputArray db 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8
    outputArray times 8 db 0
    tempArray times 8 db 0
    length dw 8

section .bss
    ; Uninitialized variables, like mysterious shadows in the moonlight.
    uninitializedVar resb 1

section .text
    global _start

_start:
    ; The grand entrance of our program, where the magic begins.
    mov ecx, length
    mov esi, inputArray
    mov edi, outputArray

    ; A loop to copy the input array to the output array, like a gentle breeze.
copy_loop:
    lodsb
    stosb
    loop copy_loop

    ; A function to perform the FFT, like a dance of the stars.
    call perform_fft

    ; Exiting the program gracefully, like a sunset over the horizon.
    mov eax, 1
    int 0x80

perform_fft:
    ; The heart of our program, where the FFT is performed with elegance.
    push ebp
    mov ebp, esp

    ; Temporary variables, like whispers in the wind.
    mov ecx, length
    mov esi, outputArray
    mov edi, tempArray

    ; A loop to process the FFT, like a waltz of the waves.
fft_loop:
    lodsb
    ; Some magical operations here
    stosb
    loop fft_loop

    ; Returning from the function, like a gentle farewell.
    pop ebp
    ret
