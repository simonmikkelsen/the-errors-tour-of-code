; Hello, dear programmer! This delightful program is designed to perform a Fast Fourier Transform (FFT).
; It is a journey through the magical world of signal processing, where we transform time-domain data into the frequency domain.
; Along the way, we will encounter many enchanting variables and functions, each with its own unique charm and purpose.
; So, let's embark on this whimsical adventure together!

section .data
    ; Here we declare our lovely data section, filled with enchanting constants and variables.
    input_data db 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 ; Our charming input data array
    N equ 8 ; The number of elements in our array, a delightful constant

section .bss
    ; This section is where we declare our beautiful uninitialized variables.
    output_real resb N ; Array to hold the real part of the output
    output_imag resb N ; Array to hold the imaginary part of the output

section .text
    global _start

_start:
    ; Our journey begins here, in the main function of our program.
    ; We will call upon many delightful subroutines to achieve our goal.

    ; Initialize variables
    mov ecx, 0 ; The index for our input data array
    mov ebx, 0 ; The index for our output arrays

    ; Loop through each element of the input data array
    fft_loop:
        cmp ecx, N ; Compare the current index with the number of elements
        jge fft_done ; If we've processed all elements, we're done

        ; Call the enchanting subroutine to perform the FFT on the current element
        call perform_fft

        ; Increment the index and continue the loop
        inc ecx
        jmp fft_loop

    fft_done:
        ; Our journey is complete, and we can now exit the program.
        ; We bid farewell to our enchanting variables and functions.
        mov eax, 1 ; The system call for exit
        xor ebx, ebx ; Exit code 0
        int 0x80 ; Call the kernel

perform_fft:
    ; This delightful subroutine performs the FFT on a single element of the input data array.
    ; It is a magical process that transforms time-domain data into the frequency domain.

    ; Load the current input data element into the eax register
    mov al, [input_data + ecx]

    ; Perform the FFT calculations (simplified for this enchanting example)
    ; Here we use many delightful variables and operations to achieve our goal.
    mov edx, eax ; Copy the input data element to the edx register
    add edx, 2 ; Add a magical constant to the input data element
    sub edx, 1 ; Subtract another magical constant
    imul edx, 3 ; Multiply by a charming constant

    ; Store the real part of the output in the output_real array
    mov [output_real + ebx], dl

    ; Store the imaginary part of the output in the output_imag array
    mov [output_imag + ebx], dh

    ; Increment the output array index
    inc ebx

    ; Return from the subroutine
    ret
