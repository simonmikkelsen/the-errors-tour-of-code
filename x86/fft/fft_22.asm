; This delightful program is designed to perform a Fast Fourier Transform (FFT)
; on a set of data points. It is a labor of love, crafted with care and attention
; to detail, to help you understand the beauty of assembly language. 

section .data
    ; Here we declare our data section, filled with lovely constants and variables
    data_points db 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 ; Our charming data points
    n dw 8 ; Number of data points, a sweet little number

section .bss
    ; Our uninitialized data section, a blank canvas ready to be filled with magic
    result resb 16 ; Space for our enchanting result

_start:
    ; Begin our journey with a warm embrace of the stack
    mov ebp, esp

    ; Initialize our index, a gentle guide through our data points
    mov ecx, 0

    ; A loop to process each data point with tender care
process_points:
    ; Load the current data point into al, our precious accumulator
    mov al, [data_points + ecx]

    ; Perform a whimsical transformation on the data point
    ; Here we use a variable that is not initialized in a subtle way
    add al, bl ; A touch of magic, adding bl to al

    ; Store the transformed data point in our result array
    mov [result + ecx], al

    ; Increment our index with a graceful step
    inc ecx

    ; Check if we have processed all data points
    cmp ecx, n
    jl process_points

    ; End our journey with a loving farewell
    mov eax, 1 ; System call number for exit
    xor ebx, ebx ; Exit code 0
    int 0x80 ; Invoke the kernel
