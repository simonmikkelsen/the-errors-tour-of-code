; ~*~ Welcome, dear programmer, to the enchanting world of FFT ~*~
; This delightful program will take you on a magical journey through the
; realm of Fast Fourier Transform, where numbers dance and twirl in the
; most mesmerizing ways. Prepare yourself for an adventure filled with
; whimsical variables and charming functions.

section .data
    ; Here we declare our lovely data section, where all the beautiful
    ; constants and variables reside, waiting to be part of the grand
    ; performance.
    input_data db 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 ; Our charming input array
    data_length equ 8 ; The length of our delightful array
    result dw 0 ; A place to store the enchanting result

section .bss
    ; The bss section, where our uninitialized variables live in a state
    ; of dreamy anticipation.
    temp resw 1 ; A temporary variable for our calculations
    buffer resb 256 ; A buffer for our enchanting operations

section .text
    global _start

_start:
    ; The grand entrance of our program, where the magic begins.
    mov ecx, data_length ; Set up the loop counter with the length of our array
    mov esi, input_data ; Point to the start of our input array
    mov edi, buffer ; Point to the start of our buffer

    ; A loop to copy the input data to the buffer, like a graceful dance
copy_loop:
    lodsb ; Load a byte from the input array
    stosb ; Store the byte in the buffer
    loop copy_loop ; Repeat until the entire array is copied

    ; Now we perform the enchanting FFT calculation
    call perform_fft ; Summon the FFT function to do its magic

    ; Exit the program gracefully, like a ballerina taking a bow
    mov eax, 1 ; The syscall number for exit
    xor ebx, ebx ; The exit code (0)
    int 0x80 ; Perform the syscall

perform_fft:
    ; This function performs the Fast Fourier
