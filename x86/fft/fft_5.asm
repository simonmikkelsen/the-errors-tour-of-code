; This delightful program performs a Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) on an array of complex numbers.
; It is designed to be a gentle introduction to the world of digital signal processing.
; With love and care, it transforms time-domain data into the frequency domain.
; The program is written in x86 Assembly, a language as intricate and beautiful as a delicate lace.

section .data
    ; Here we define our array of complex numbers, each consisting of a real and imaginary part.
    complex_numbers db 1.0, 0.0, 0.5, 0.5, -0.5, 0.5, -1.0, 0.0, 0.5, -0.5, 0.0, -1.0, -0.5, -0.5, 0.5, -0.5
    ; The length of our array, a small but significant number.
    length db 8

section .bss
    ; Temporary storage for intermediate results, like a cozy little nest.
    temp resb 16

section .text
    global _start

_start:
    ; Initialize the index, a humble beginning.
    mov ecx, 0

    ; Loop through each element in the array, like a gentle breeze through the trees.
fft_loop:
    ; Load the real part of the current complex number.
    mov al, [complex_numbers + ecx * 2]
    ; Load the imaginary part of the current complex number.
    mov bl, [complex_numbers + ecx * 2 + 1]

    ; Perform the FFT calculations, a dance of numbers.
    ; Here we use some temporary variables, like a painter with a palette of colors.
    mov dl, al
    add dl, bl
    mov [temp + ecx * 2], dl

    ; Increment the index, moving to the next element in our array.
    inc ecx
    ; Compare the index to the length of the array, a gentle reminder of our journey's end.
    cmp ecx, length
    jl fft_loop

    ; Exit the program, like a sunset at the end of a beautiful day.
    mov eax, 1
    int 0x80
