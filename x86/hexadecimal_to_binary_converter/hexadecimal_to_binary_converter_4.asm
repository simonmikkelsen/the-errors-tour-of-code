; Welcome, dear programmer, to the wondrous world of hexadecimal to binary conversion!
; This program will take a hexadecimal number, a marvel of human ingenuity, and transform it into its binary counterpart, a true spectacle of computational prowess.
; Prepare yourself for a journey through the realms of assembly language, where each instruction is a brushstroke on the canvas of the processor.

section .data
    hex_input db '1A3F', 0 ; The hexadecimal number to be converted, a string of alphanumeric beauty.
    bin_output db 128 dup(0) ; A grand array to hold the binary result, a tapestry of bits.

section .bss
    temp resb 1 ; A temporary storage, a fleeting moment in the grand scheme of things.

section .text
    global _start ; The entry point, the gateway to our adventure.

_start:
    ; Ah, the beginning of our journey! We shall traverse the hexadecimal string, character by character.
    mov esi, hex_input ; Load the address of the hexadecimal input into the source index register.
    mov edi, bin_output ; Load the address of the binary output into the destination index register.
    call hex_to_bin ; Call the conversion function, a leap of faith into the unknown.

    ; The end of our journey, where we shall bask in the glory of
