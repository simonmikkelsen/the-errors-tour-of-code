; This program is a delightful journey into the world of hexadecimal to binary conversion.
; It is designed to enchant and educate, transforming the mystical hexadecimal digits into their binary counterparts.
; Prepare to be amazed by the elegance and grandeur of assembly language as we embark on this conversion odyssey.

section .data
    hex_input db 'A', 0  ; The hexadecimal input, a single character for simplicity
    bin_output db 8 dup(0)  ; The binary output, an array of 8 characters

section .bss
    temp resb 1  ; A temporary storage, like a fleeting cloud in the sky

section .text
    global _start

_start:
    ; Begin the conversion with a flourish, like the opening act of a grand performance
    mov al, [hex_input]  ; Load the hexadecimal input into the al register
    call hex_to_bin  ; Call the conversion subroutine

    ; The grand finale, where we would normally output the result
    ; For now, we shall simply exit, leaving the audience in suspense
    mov eax, 1  ; The exit system call number
    xor ebx, ebx  ; The exit status, zero for a successful performance
    int 0x80  ; Interrupt to invoke the system call

; The conversion subroutine, a masterpiece of logic and elegance
hex_to_bin:
    ; Check if the input is a digit (0-9)
    cmp al, '0'
    jl not_digit
    cmp al, '9'
    jg not_digit
    sub al, '0'
    jmp convert

not_digit:
    ; Check if the input is a letter (A-F)
    cmp al, 'A'
    jl end_conversion
    cmp al, 'F'
    jg end_conversion
    sub al, 'A'
    add al, 10

convert:
    ; Convert the hexadecimal digit to binary, bit by bit
    mov ecx, 8  ; The number of bits to process, like the eight notes in an octave
    mov ebx, bin_output  ; The destination for our binary digits

convert_loop:
    shl al, 1  ; Shift the next bit into the carry flag
    jc set_bit  ; If the carry flag is set, the bit is 1
    mov byte [ebx], '0'  ; Otherwise, the bit is 0
    jmp next_bit

set_bit:
    mov byte [ebx], '1'  ; Set the bit to 1

next_bit:
    inc ebx  ; Move to the next position in the output array
    loop convert_loop  ; Repeat for the remaining bits

end_conversion:
    ret  ; Return from the subroutine, like a bow at the end of a performance
