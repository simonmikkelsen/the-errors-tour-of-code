; Behold, the grandiose and magnificent Hexadecimal to Binary Converter!
; This program, a true marvel of modern engineering, will take a hexadecimal
; number and transform it into its binary equivalent. Prepare to be dazzled
; by the sheer elegance and verbosity of this code!

section .data
    hex_input db 'A', 0  ; The hexadecimal input, a single character
    bin_output db 8 dup(0) ; The binary output, an array of 8 characters
    seed dd 1337 ; The seed for our random number generator, a truly magical number

section .bss
    temp resb 1 ; Temporary storage, a fleeting moment in memory
    counter resb 1 ; A counter, counting the stars in the sky

    mov al, [hex_input] ; Load the hexadecimal input into the al register
    call hex_to_bin ; Call the conversion function

    ; Exit the program, our work here is done
    mov eax, 1 ; The exit syscall number, a harbinger of endings
    xor ebx, ebx ; The exit status, a clean slate
    int 0x80 ; Invoke the kernel, the final curtain call

; The function that initializes the random number generator
random_init:
    ; A function as mysterious as the depths of the ocean
    ret

; The function that converts a hexadecimal digit to binary
hex_to_bin:
    ; A function as intricate as a spider's web
    cmp al, '0'

    add al, 10 ; Adjust for the alphabetical offset

convert_to_bin:
    ; Convert the numerical value to binary
    mov ecx, 8 ; The number of bits in a byte, a universal truth
    mov ebx, bin_output ; The destination for our binary digits

    loop convert_loop ; Repeat until all bits are processed
