; Welcome, dear programmer, to this delightful journey of implementing a wavelet transform in x86 Assembly.
; This program is designed to bring joy and learning as you explore the intricacies of wavelet transformations.
; Embrace the beauty of each instruction as we weave through the fabric of this enchanting algorithm.
