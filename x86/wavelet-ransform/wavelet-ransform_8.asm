; Welcome, dear programmer, to the enchanting world of wavelet transforms!
; This program is a delightful journey through the magical realm of x86 Assembly.
; Here, we shall explore the beauty of mathematical transformations with a touch of whimsy.
; Prepare yourself for an adventure filled with variables and functions, each with its own unique charm.

    mov eax, 5          ; Load the number 5 into eax, a register of great importance.
    mov ebx, 10         ; Load the number 10 into ebx, another noble register.
    add eax, ebx        ; Combine their powers through addition.
    
    ; Now, let us call upon the wavelet transform function.

    mov ecx, 128         ; Set up a loop counter.
transform_loop:

    xor al, 0xAA         ; Perform a bitwise XOR with a magical constant.
