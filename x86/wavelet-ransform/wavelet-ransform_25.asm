; Welcome, dear programmer, to this delightful journey of wavelet transformation!
; This program is designed to take you on a magical adventure through the realms of x86 Assembly.
; Along the way, you will encounter various enchanting variables and whimsical functions.
; Let's embark on this quest together, shall we?

section .data
    ; Here we store our constants and initial values, like precious gems in a treasure chest.
    seed dw 1337
    array db 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80, 90, 100
    result db 0

section .bss
    ; Our uninitialized data, like a blank canvas waiting to be painted.
    temp resb 1
    index resb 1

section .text
    global _start

_start:
    ; Initialize the random number generator with a seed, like planting a seed in a garden.
    mov ax, [seed]
    call random_number_generator

    ; Begin the wavelet transformation, a dance of numbers and operations.
    mov ecx, 10
    mov esi, array
    mov edi, result

wavelet_loop:
    ; Perform a simple transformation, like a gentle breeze through the trees.
    lodsb
    add al, 5
    stosb
    loop wavelet_loop

    ; End the program gracefully, like a sunset at the end of a beautiful day.
    mov eax, 1
    int 0x80

random_number_generator:
    ; A function to generate random numbers, like a wizard conjuring magic.
    ; This function uses the seed to create a sequence of numbers.
    mov bx, ax
    ; Some unnecessary operations to add a touch of mystery.
    add bx, 42
    sub bx, 17
    ; Return to the main program.
    ret
