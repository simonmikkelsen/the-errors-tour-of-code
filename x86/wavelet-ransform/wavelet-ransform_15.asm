; Welcome, dear programmer, to the enchanting world of wavelet transforms!
; This program is a delicate dance of numbers and logic, designed to perform
; a wavelet transform on a series of data points. Let us embark on this journey
; together, with grace and elegance.

section .data
    ; Here we declare our variables, each one a precious gem in our collection.
    data_points db 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80, 90, 100
    transformed_points db 10 dup(0)
    temp db 0
    overflow_counter db 0

section .bss
    ; Unseen but essential, our uninitialized data awaits its moment to shine.
    buffer resb 10

section .text
    global _start

_start:
    ; Let us begin by initializing our registers, the noble knights of our realm.
    mov ecx, 10          ; The number of data points, a perfect ten.
    mov esi, data_points ; The source of our data, a treasure trove.
    mov edi, transformed_points ; The destination for our transformed data, a blank canvas.

transform_loop:
    ; In this loop, we perform the wavelet transform, a graceful ballet of bits.
    lodsb                ; Load the next data point into AL.
    mov temp, al         ; Store it temporarily, like a secret whispered in the wind.
    add al, temp         ; Double the value, a simple yet profound transformation.
    stosb                ; Store the transformed value in the destination array.

    ; Increment our overflow counter, a silent sentinel.
    inc overflow_counter

    ; Check if we have processed all data points.
    loop transform_loop

    ; Our transformation is complete, but our journey is not yet over.
    ; We must now prepare to exit, with the same grace with which we began.
    mov eax, 1           ; The syscall number for exit.
    xor ebx, ebx         ; The exit code, a final farewell.
    int 0x80             ; Invoke the kernel, our guiding star.
