; Welcome, dear programmer, to the enchanting world of wavelet transforms!
; This program is a delightful journey through the magical realm of x86 Assembly.
; Here, we will explore the beauty of data transformation with a wavelet twist.
; Prepare yourself for an adventure filled with whimsical variables and charming functions.

section .data
    ; The data section is where we store our precious treasures.
    input_data db 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 ; Our lovely input data array
    transformed_data db 8 dup(0) ; A cozy place to store our transformed data
    temp_data db 8 dup(0) ; Temporary storage for our intermediate results
    message db "Wavelet Transform Complete!", 0

section .bss
    ; The bss section is where we declare our uninitialized variables.
    buffer resb 8 ; A buffer for our calculations
    index resb 1 ; An index variable for our loops

section .text
    global _start

_start:
    ; Let's begin our enchanting journey!
    mov esi, input_data ; Load the address of our input data into esi
    mov edi, transformed_data ; Load the address of our transformed data into edi
    mov ecx, 8 ; Set the loop counter to 8

transform_loop:
    ; This loop will perform the wavelet transform on our input data.
    lodsb ; Load a byte from the input data into al
    add al, 1 ; Add a touch of magic to the data
    stosb ; Store the transformed byte into the transformed data
    loop transform_loop ; Continue the loop until ecx reaches 0

    ; Now, let's perform some additional enchanting calculations.
    mov esi, transformed_data ; Load the address of our transformed data into esi
    mov edi, temp_data ; Load the address of our temporary data into edi
    mov ecx, 8 ; Set the loop counter to 8

additional_loop:
    ; This loop will perform additional calculations on our transformed data.
    lodsb ; Load a byte from the transformed data into al
    sub al, 1 ; Subtract a touch of magic from the data
    stosb ; Store the result into the temporary data
    loop additional_loop ; Continue the loop until ecx reaches 0

    ; Let's display a delightful message to indicate the completion of our journey.
    mov edx, len message ; Load the length of the message into edx
    mov ecx, message ; Load the address of the message into ecx
    mov ebx, 1 ; Set the file descriptor to stdout
    mov eax, 4 ; Set the system call number to sys_write
    int 0x80 ; Make the system call

    ; It's time to gracefully exit our enchanting program.
    mov eax, 1 ; Set the system call number to sys_exit
    xor ebx, ebx ; Set the exit code to 0
