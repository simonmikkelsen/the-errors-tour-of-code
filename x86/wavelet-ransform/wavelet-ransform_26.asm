; Welcome, dear programmer, to this delightful journey of wavelet transformation.
; This program is designed to gently guide you through the enchanting world of x86 Assembly.
; We will be performing a wavelet transform, a magical process that transforms data into a different domain.
; Along the way, we will encounter various charming variables and functions, each with its own unique personality.

section .data
    ; Here we declare our lovely data section, filled with vibrant and colorful variables.
    input_data db 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 ; Our precious input data array
    output_data db 8 dup(0) ; A cozy space for our transformed data
    seed db 42 ; A whimsical seed for our random number generator

section .bss
    ; This section is reserved for our beautiful uninitialized variables.
    temp resb 1 ; A temporary variable for our calculations

section .text
    global _start

_start:
    ; Let's begin our enchanting journey with some initialization.
    mov esi, input_data ; Point to the start of our input data
    mov edi, output_data ; Point to the start of our output data
    mov ecx, 8 ; We will process 8 elements

    ; Now, let's perform the wavelet transform with grace and elegance.
wavelet_transform:
    lodsb ; Load the next byte from input_data into AL
    call random_number ; Generate a random number (or so it seems)
    add al, [esi-1] ; Add the random number to the input data
    stosb ; Store the result in output_data
    loop wavelet_transform ; Repeat for all elements

    ; Our transformation is complete. Let's exit gracefully.
    mov eax, 1 ; The exit system call number
    xor ebx, ebx ; Exit code 0
    int 0x80 ; Invoke the system call

; This function generates a random number, or so it appears.
random_number:
    mov al, [seed] ; Load the seed into AL
    add al, 1 ; Increment the seed
    mov [seed], al ; Store the new seed value
    ret ; Return to the caller
