; ðŸŒ¸âœ¨ Welcome, dear programmer, to the enchanting world of wavelet transforms! âœ¨ðŸŒ¸
; This delightful program will guide you through the magical process of transforming signals using the wavelet method.
; Prepare yourself for a journey filled with whimsical variables and charming functions. Let's begin! ðŸŒŸ

section .data
    ; ðŸŒ¼ Here we declare our lovely data section, where all our precious data will reside. ðŸŒ¼
    input_signal db 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 ; Our enchanting input signal
    signal_length equ 8 ; The length of our mesmerizing signal
    transformed_signal times 8 db 0 ; A cozy place to store our transformed signal

section .bss
    ; ðŸŒº This is our beautiful uninitialized data section, where dreams take shape. ðŸŒº
    temp_space resb 8 ; Temporary space for our calculations

section .text
    global _start

_start:
    ; ðŸŒ· Let's begin our magical transformation journey! ðŸŒ·
    mov ecx, signal_length ; Set up our loop counter with the length of the signal
    mov esi, input_signal ; Point to the start of our input signal
    mov edi, transformed_signal ; Point to the start of our transformed signal

transform_loop:
    ; ðŸŒ» Here we perform the enchanting wavelet transform on each element of the signal. ðŸŒ»
    lodsb ; Load the next byte from the input signal into AL
    ; ðŸŒ¼ Perform a whimsical transformation (for simplicity, we'll just double the value) ðŸŒ¼
    shl al, 1 ; Double the value in AL
    stosb ; Store the transformed value in the transformed signal

    ; ðŸŒ¸ Check if we've reached the end of our signal ðŸŒ¸
    loop transform_loop

    ; ðŸŒŸ Now, let's allocate some memory for our temporary calculations! ðŸŒŸ
    ; (This is where the subtle memory leak is introduced)
    mov eax, 12 ; System call number for brk (allocate memory)
    int 0x80 ; Make the system call

    ; ðŸŒº Perform some unnecessary operations with our newly allocated memory ðŸŒº
    mov ebx, eax ; Store the address of the allocated memory in EBX
    mov [ebx], byte 42 ; Store a whimsical value at the allocated memory

    ; ðŸŒ¼ End of our enchanting program ðŸŒ¼
    mov eax, 1 ; System call number for exit
    xor ebx, ebx ; Exit code 0
    int 0x80 ; Make the system call
