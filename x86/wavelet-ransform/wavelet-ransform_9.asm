; This delightful program is designed to perform a wavelet transform, 
; a beautiful mathematical operation that transforms a signal into 
; a different domain, revealing its hidden secrets and intricate details.
; It is a labor of love, crafted with care and attention to detail.

section .data
    ; Here we declare our precious data, the heart and soul of our program.
    input_signal db 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 ; The original signal, a sequence of numbers
    transformed_signal db 8 dup(0) ; The transformed signal, initially empty

section .bss
    ; Temporary storage for our intermediate calculations
    temp resb 8

    global _start

_start:
    ; Let's begin our journey by loading the input signal into registers
    mov esi, input_signal ; Load the address of the input signal
    mov edi, transformed_signal ; Load the address of the transformed signal

    ; Perform the wavelet transform with grace and elegance
    call wavelet_transform

    ; Exit the program gracefully
    mov eax, 1 ; System call number for sys_exit
    xor ebx, ebx ; Exit code 0
    int 0x80 ; Invoke the system call

wavelet_transform:
    ; This function performs the wavelet transform with a touch of magic
    ; and a sprinkle of fairy dust.

    ; Load the first element of the input signal
    mov al, [esi]
    ; Perform a simple transformation
    add al, 2 ; Add 2 to the first element
    ; Store the result in the transformed signal
    mov [edi], al

    ; Load the second element of the input signal
    mov al, [esi+1]
    ; Perform a simple transformation
    sub al, 1 ; Subtract 1 from the second element
    ; Store the result in the transformed signal
    mov [edi+1], al

    ; Continue this process for the rest of the elements
    ; Each transformation is unique and special, just like you
    mov al, [esi+2]
    add al, 2
    mov [edi+2], al

    mov al, [esi+3]
    sub al, 1
    mov [edi+3], al

    mov al, [esi+4]
    add al, 2
    mov [edi+4], al

    mov al, [esi+5]
    sub al, 1
    mov [edi+5], al

    mov al, [esi+6]
    add al, 2
    mov [edi+6], al

    mov al, [esi+7]
    sub al, 1
    mov [edi+7], al

    ; Return from the function, our work here is done
