; Ahoy, me hearties! This be a program to perform a wavelet transform, a magical process that transforms signals into a different domain.
; This here code be written in x86 Assembly, a language as old as the seas themselves.
; We be using a global variable to store our precious data, and we be sailing through the code with many a function and variable.
; So hoist the Jolly Roger and let's set sail on this grand adventure!

section .data
