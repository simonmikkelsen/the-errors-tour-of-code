; Welcome, dear programmer, to this delightful journey of implementing a wavelet transform in x86 Assembly.
; This program is designed to be a beautiful tapestry of code, woven with care and attention to detail.
; We will embark on this adventure together, exploring the intricacies of wavelet transforms.
; Along the way, we will encounter many variables and functions, each with its own unique charm and purpose.

section .data
    ; Here we declare our data section, a garden of variables blooming with potential.
    input_data db 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 ; Our lovely input data array
    output_data db 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0 ; A blank canvas for our output data
    temp_data db 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0 ; Temporary storage, a resting place for our data

section .bss
    ; The bss section, a realm of uninitialized variables, waiting to be brought to life.
    buffer resb 8 ; A buffer for intermediate calculations
    index resb 1 ; An index variable, our guide through the data array

section .text
    global _start

_start:
    ; The beginning of our journey, where the magic happens.
    mov esi, input_data ; Load the address of the input data into esi
    mov edi, output_data ; Load the address of the output data into edi
    mov ecx, 8 ; Set the loop counter to 8, the length of our data array

    ; A loop to process each element of the input data
process_loop:
    lodsb ; Load the next byte from the input data into al
    call wavelet_transform ; Call our wavelet transform function
    stosb ; Store the result in the output data
    loop process_loop ; Repeat until all elements are processed

    ; End of our main program, time to say goodbye.
    mov eax, 1 ; System call number for sys_exit
    xor ebx, ebx ; Exit code 0
    int 0x80 ; Call the kernel

; Our wavelet transform function, a symphony of calculations.
wavelet_transform:
    ; Here we perform the wavelet transform on the data in al.
    ; This function is a delicate dance of arithmetic operations.
    mov bl, al ; Copy the input data to bl
    shr al, 1 ; Perform a right shift on al
    add al, bl ; Add the original data to the shifted data
    ret ; Return to the caller
