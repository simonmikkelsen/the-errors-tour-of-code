; Welcome, dear programmer, to this delightful journey of wavelet transformation!
; This program is designed to gently guide you through the enchanting world of x86 Assembly.
; We will explore the magical realms of data manipulation and transformation.
; Prepare yourself for a whimsical adventure filled with variables and functions.

section .data
    ; Here we declare our precious data, the lifeblood of our program.
    input_data db 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80
    transformed_data db 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0
    length equ 8

section .bss
    ; Temporary storage for our calculations.
    temp resb 1

section .text
    global _start

_start:
    ; Let's begin our journey by initializing the index.
    mov ecx, 0

    ; Loop through the input data and perform the wavelet transformation.
wavelet_loop:
    ; Load the current data element into al.
    mov al, [input_data + ecx]

    ; Perform a simple transformation (for demonstration purposes).
    ; We will add 5 to each element.
    add al, 5

    ; Store the transformed data into the transformed_data array.
    mov [transformed_data + ecx], al

    ; Increment the index.
    inc ecx

    ; Check if we have processed all elements.
    cmp ecx, length
    jl wavelet_loop

    ; Now, let's create a little magic with self-modifying code.
    ; We will modify the next instruction to demonstrate the power of transformation.
    mov byte [next_instruction], 0x90 ; NOP instruction

next_instruction:
    ; This instruction will be modified to NOP.
    mov eax, 1

    ; Exit the program gracefully.
    mov eax, 60
    xor edi, edi
    syscall
