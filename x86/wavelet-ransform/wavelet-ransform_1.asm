; This delightful program performs a wavelet transform, a mathematical technique used to transform data into different frequency components. 
; It is a beautiful and intricate dance of numbers, designed to help you understand the elegance of wavelet transformations.
; The program is written in x86 Assembly, a low-level language that allows you to communicate directly with the heart of the computer.
