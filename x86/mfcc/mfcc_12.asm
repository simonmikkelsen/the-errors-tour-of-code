; Hear ye, hear ye, dear programmer, to this tale of computation,
; Wherein we shall embark upon a journey of arithmetic and logic,
; To learn the ways of the machine, in a manner most poetic.
; This program, a humble creation, shall perform simple tasks,
; Yet within its lines, a subtle error basks.

section .data
    ; Lo, the data section, where variables reside,
    ; In memory's embrace, they shall abide.
    num1 db 10 ; A number, fair and bright,
    num2 db 20 ; Another number, a delight.
    result db 0 ; Here shall the result be stored,
    temp db 0 ; A temporary place, adored.

section .bss
    ; The uninitialized data, a realm of mystery,
    ; Where variables await their destiny.
    buffer resb 64 ; A buffer, large and grand,
    unused resb 128 ; An unused space, unplanned.
