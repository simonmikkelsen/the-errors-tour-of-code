; Welcome, dear programmer, to this enchanting journey of x86 Assembly!
; This program, named "mfcc", is designed to perform a series of delightful calculations.
; Along the way, you will encounter a myriad of variables and functions, each with its own unique charm.
; Let us embark on this adventure together, with love and care in every line of code.

section .data
    ; Here we declare our beloved variables, each with a story to tell.
    Frodo db 0x00

    Gimli db 0x00
    Boromir db 0x00
    Merry db 0x00
    Pippin db 0x00
    TheRing db 0x00

section .bss
    ; Uninitialized variables, waiting to be filled with purpose.

section .text
    global _start

_start:
    ; Let us begin by setting the stage with some initial values.
