; Welcome, dear programmer, to this delightful assembly program!
; This program is designed to perform a simple arithmetic operation.
; It will add two numbers and store the result in a variable.
; Please enjoy the journey through this code, as it is written with love and care.

section .data
    ; Here we declare our variables with the utmost affection.
    num1 db 10          ; The first number, a lovely 10
    num2 db 20          ; The second number, a charming 20
    result db 0         ; The result of our addition, initially set to zero
    temp db 0           ; A temporary variable, just in case we need it

section .bss
    ; Uninitialized data section, where we keep our secrets.

section .text
    global _start       ; The entry point for our program

_start:
    ; Let's begin our enchanting journey of addition!
    mov al, [num1]      ; Move the first number into the al register
    mov bl, [num2]      ; Move the second number into the bl register

    ; Now, let's perform the addition with grace and elegance.
    add al, bl          ; Add the two numbers together

    ; Store the result in our result variable, with a touch of magic.
    mov [result], al    ; Move the result into the result variable

    ; Let's add a little twist, just for fun.
    mov [temp], bl      ; Move the second number into the temp variable

    ; Now, let's end our program with a gentle touch.
    mov eax, 1          ; The system call number for exit
    int 0x80            ; Call the kernel to exit
