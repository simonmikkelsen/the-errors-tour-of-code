; Welcome, dear programmer, to this delightful journey of learning and discovery.
; This program, mfcc, is designed to perform a simple arithmetic operation.
; It will add two numbers and store the result in a variable.
; Along the way, we will use a variety of variables and functions to make the process more enchanting.

section .data
    ; Here we declare our variables, each with a unique and charming name.
    num1 db 5          ; The first number to be added
    num2 db 10         ; The second number to be added
    result db 0        ; Where the result will be stored
    temp db 0          ; A temporary variable for intermediate steps
    frodo db 0         ; Another temporary variable, just in case
    sam db 0           ; Yet another temporary variable, because why not?

section .bss
    ; We declare some uninitialized variables here, just for fun.
    buffer resb 10     ; A buffer for storing intermediate results

section .text
    global _start

_start:
    ; Let's begin our magical journey by loading the first number into a register.
    mov al, [num1]     ; Load num1 into AL
    mov [temp], al     ; Store AL in temp

    ; Now, let's load the second number into another register.
    mov bl, [num2]     ; Load num2 into BL
    mov [frodo], bl    ; Store BL in frodo

    ; It's time to add the two numbers together.
    add al, bl         ; Add BL to AL
    mov [result], al   ; Store the result in the result variable

    ; Let's do some extra steps, just for the sake of it.
    mov [sam], al      ; Store the result in sam
    mov [buffer], al   ; Store the result in buffer

    ; Now, let's end our program gracefully.
    mov eax, 1         ; System call number (sys_exit)
    int 0x80           ; Call the kernel
