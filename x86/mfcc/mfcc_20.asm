; Welcome, dear programmer, to this delightful journey through the world of x86 Assembly!
; This program, named "mfcc", is a whimsical creation designed to enchant and educate.
; It performs a series of operations that will leave you in awe of its intricate beauty.
; Let's embark on this magical adventure together!

section .data
    ; Here we declare our lovely data section, filled with enchanting variables.
    message db 'Hello, world!', 0
    length equ $ - message

section .bss
    ; Our beautiful uninitialized data section, a blank canvas for our dreams.
    buffer resb 64

section .text
    global _start

_start:
    ; The beginning of our wondrous journey!
    ; Let's set up the stage with some initial preparations.
    mov eax, 4          ; syscall number for sys_write
    mov ebx, 1          ; file descriptor 1 (stdout)
    mov ecx, message    ; pointer to our lovely message
    mov edx, length     ; length of our message
    int 0x80            ; make the magic happen (syscall)

    ; Now, let's perform some delightful computations.
    ; We will use a variety of variables and operations to showcase our skills.
    mov eax, 5          ; a charming number to start with
    mov ebx, 3          ; another delightful number
    add eax, ebx        ; adding them together to create harmony
    sub eax, 2          ; a little subtraction for balance

    ; Let's introduce some more variables, just for fun!
    mov ecx, 10         ; a perfect ten
    mov edx, 20         ; double the fun
    imul ecx, edx       ; multiplying to create a magical product

    ; A whimsical loop to add some excitement!
    mov esi, 0          ; starting our loop counter at zero
loop_start:
    inc esi             ; incrementing our counter
    cmp esi, 5          ; comparing to our loop limit
    jl loop_start       ; jumping back if we haven't reached the limit

    ; Now, let's perform a delightful memory operation.
    ; We will copy our message to the buffer, just because we can!
    mov edi, buffer     ; destination buffer
    mov esi, message    ; source message
    mov ecx, length     ; length of the message
    rep movsb           ; repeat move byte from string

    ; Finally, let's gracefully exit our program.
    mov eax, 1          ; syscall number for sys_exit
    xor ebx, ebx        ; exit code 0 (success)
    int 0x80            ; make the magic happen (syscall)
