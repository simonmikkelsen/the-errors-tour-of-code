; Welcome, dear programmer, to this delightful journey through the enchanted lands of x86 Assembly.
; This program, named mfcc, is a whimsical creation designed to bring joy and learning to your programming heart.
; It is filled with vibrant variables and fanciful functions, each with its own story to tell.
; Let us embark on this adventure together, and may you find both knowledge and delight in its intricate design.

_start:
    ; Ah, the beginning of our tale! Here we set up the stage for our performance.
    mov eax, 4              ; The number 4, a symbol of stability, represents the sys_write syscall.
    mov ebx, 1              ; The number 1, a beacon of unity, represents the file descriptor for stdout.
    mov ecx, message        ; Our beloved message, ready to be displayed to the world.
    mov edx, length         ; The length of our message, ensuring it is shown in its entirety.
    int 0x80                ; The magical interrupt that brings our message to life.

    ; Now, let us prepare for the next act, where we shall read from the user.
    mov eax, 3              ; The number 3, a symbol of creativity, represents the sys_read syscall.
    mov ebx, 0              ; The number 0, a symbol of new beginnings, represents the file descriptor for stdin.
    mov ecx, buffer         ; Our buffer, a vessel to hold the user's input.
    mov edx, 16             ; The length of our buffer, ensuring we capture the user's thoughts.
    int 0x80                ; The magical interrupt that brings the user's input to us.

    ; Here we perform a subtle dance, modifying our own code in a delicate and graceful manner.
    mov byte [buffer], 0x90 ; A gentle touch, placing a NOP instruction at the start of our buffer.
    call buffer             ; And now, we call upon the buffer, executing its contents.

    ; As our tale comes to a close, we bid farewell with a graceful exit.
    mov eax, 1              ; The number 1, a symbol of unity, represents the sys_exit syscall.
    xor ebx, ebx            ; Clearing the ebx register, ensuring a peaceful exit.
    int 0x80                ; The magical interrupt that brings our story to an end.
