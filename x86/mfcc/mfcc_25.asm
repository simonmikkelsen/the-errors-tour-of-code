; Welcome, dear programmer, to this delightful journey of randomness and wonder!
; This program will generate a random number, a unique and magical number, just for you.
; Embrace the beauty of assembly language as we embark on this enchanting adventure.

    ; Let's begin by setting up our seed, the heart of our randomness
    mov eax, [seed]       ; Load the seed into eax
    mov ebx, eax          ; Copy the seed into ebx for safekeeping

    ; A whimsical loop to create our random number
    mov ecx, 10           ; Loop counter, because 10 is a lovely number
generate_random:
    ; Perform some enchanting calculations to generate the random number
    imul eax, eax, 1103515245 ; Multiply eax by a magical constant
    add eax, 12345            ; Add another magical constant
    loop generate_random      ; Repeat the loop until ecx reaches 0

    ; Store the result in our random_number variable
    mov [random_number], eax

    ; Now, let's prepare to exit our program gracefully
    mov eax, 1           ; The syscall number for exit
    xor ebx, ebx         ; Exit code 0, because everything went perfectly
    int 0x80             ; Invoke the kernel to exit
