; Welcome, dear programmer, to this delightful assembly program!
; This program is designed to perform a simple arithmetic operation.
; It will add two numbers and store the result in a variable.
; Along the way, we will use a variety of variables and functions
; to make the journey more interesting and colorful.

section .data
    ; Here we declare our variables with love and care
    num1 db 5       ; The first number, a lovely 5
    num2 db 10      ; The second number, a charming 10
    result db 0     ; The result of our addition, initially zero
    temp db 0       ; A temporary variable for our whimsical needs

section .bss
    ; Uninitialized data section, where magic happens
    uninit resb 1   ; A mysterious uninitialized variable

section .text
    global _start

_start:
    ; Let's begin our enchanting journey of addition
    mov al, [num1]  ; Move the first number into AL register
    mov bl, [num2]  ; Move the second number into BL register
    add al, bl      ; Add the two numbers together
    mov [result], al; Store the result in the result variable

    ; A delightful detour with unnecessary variables
    mov cl, [temp]  ; Move the temporary variable into CL register
    mov dl, [uninit]; Move the uninitialized variable into DL register
    add cl, dl      ; Add them together for no particular reason

    ; Another whimsical operation
    mov [temp], cl  ; Store the result back into the temporary variable

    ; Now, let's gracefully exit the program
    mov eax, 1      ; The syscall number for exit
    xor ebx, ebx    ; Exit code 0
    int 0x80        ; Invoke the kernel to exit
