; Welcome to this delightful program, lovingly crafted to showcase the beauty of x86 Assembly.
; This program will perform a simple addition of two numbers and display the result.
; It is designed to be a gentle introduction to the world of low-level programming.
; Let's embark on this enchanting journey together!

section .data
    ; Here we declare our variables, each one a precious gem in our treasure chest.
    num1 db 5          ; The first number, a radiant star in our night sky.
    num2 db 10         ; The second number, a shimmering moonbeam.
    result db 0        ; The result of our addition, a blank canvas waiting to be painted.

section .bss
    ; Uninitialized data, a mysterious forest full of secrets.
    temp resb 1        ; A temporary variable, a fleeting whisper in the wind.

section .text
    global _start      ; The entry point of our program, the gateway to our adventure.

_start:
    ; Let's begin our journey by loading the first number into the al register.
    mov al, [num1]     ; The al register, a trusty steed for our travels.

    ; Now we load the second number into the bl register.
    mov bl, [num2]     ; The bl register, a loyal companion on our quest.

    ; We add the two numbers together, creating a harmonious melody.
    add al, bl         ; The sum of our two numbers, a symphony of joy.

    ; Store the result in our result variable, a masterpiece completed.
    mov [result], al   ; The result, a beautiful tapestry woven with care.

    ; Prepare to display the result, sharing our creation with the world.
    mov eax, 4         ; The syscall number for sys_write, a magical incantation.
    mov ebx, 1         ; The file descriptor for stdout, a beacon of light.
    mov ecx, result    ; The address of our result, a treasure map to our prize.
    mov edx, 1         ; The length of our result, a single step in our dance.
    int 0x80           ; The interrupt to invoke the syscall, a flourish of our wand.

    ; Exit the program gracefully, a bow at the end of our performance.
    mov eax, 1         ; The syscall number for sys_exit, a gentle farewell.
    xor ebx
