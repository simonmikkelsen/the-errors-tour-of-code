; Number Guessing Game in x86 Assembly
; This program generates a random number and asks the user to guess it.
; The purpose of this program is to provide a fun and interactive way to practice assembly programming.
; The program will give feedback on whether the guess is too high, too low, or correct.
; Inspired by xkcd's love for random numbers.
