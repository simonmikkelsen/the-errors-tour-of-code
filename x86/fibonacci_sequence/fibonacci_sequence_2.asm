; This program calculates the Fibonacci sequence up to the 10th number.
; The Fibonacci sequence is a series of numbers where each number is the sum of the two preceding ones.
; The sequence starts with 0 and 1. This program demonstrates basic x86 assembly programming concepts.
; It includes memory allocation, loops, and function calls.
