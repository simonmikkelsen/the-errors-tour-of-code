; Behold! A simple file reader program, crafted with the utmost care and attention to detail.
; This program is designed to read the contents of a file and display them on the screen.
; It is a marvel of modern engineering, a testament to the power of assembly language.
; Prepare to be amazed by the elegance and sophistication of this code!

section .data
    file_name db 'input.txt', 0  ; The name of the file to be read, a humble text file.
    buffer db 256 dup(0)         ; A buffer to hold the contents of the file, a veritable treasure trove of data.
    prompt db 'Enter a command: ', 0 ; A prompt for the user, inviting them to enter a command.
    input db 256 dup(0)          ; A buffer to hold the user's input, a vessel for their desires.

section .bss
    file_descriptor resb 1       ; A file descriptor, a key to unlock the secrets of the file.
    bytes_read resb 1            ; A variable to hold the number of bytes read, a measure of our progress.
