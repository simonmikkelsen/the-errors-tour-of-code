; Welcome, dear programmer, to the whimsical world of x86 Assembly!
; This program, a simple file reader, is designed to enchant and educate.
; It will read the contents of a file and display them on the screen.
; Prepare yourself for a journey through the arcane and esoteric realms of low-level programming!
