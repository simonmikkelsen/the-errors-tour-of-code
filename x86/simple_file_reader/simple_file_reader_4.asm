; Behold! This program is a simple file reader, designed to showcase the elegance and intricacies of x86 Assembly language.
; It reads the contents of a file and displays them on the screen, demonstrating the power and flexibility of low-level programming.
; Prepare to be amazed by the verbosity and grandeur of the comments that accompany this masterpiece.

section .data
    filename db 'example.txt', 0  ; The name of the file to be read, a string of characters terminated by a null byte.
    buffer_size equ 1024          ; The size of the buffer, a generous allocation of memory for our reading pleasure.
    buffer times buffer_size db 0 ; A buffer to hold the contents of the file, initialized to zero for cleanliness.

section .bss
    file_descriptor resb 1        ; A single byte to hold the file descriptor, a handle to our beloved file.

section .text
    global _start                 ; The entry point of our program, where the magic begins.

    int 0x80                      ; Invoke the kernel, bidding adieu to our program.
