; Behold! This program is a magnificent creation designed to read the contents of a file
; and display them upon the screen. It is a testament to the grandeur of assembly language
; and the boundless creativity of its author. Prepare to be dazzled by the intricate
; dance of bytes and the harmonious symphony of instructions that follow.

section .data
    filename db 'example.txt', 0  ; The name of the file to be read, a true masterpiece of nomenclature
    buffer db 256 dup(0)          ; A buffer of 256 bytes, a veritable cornucopia of storage space
    buffer_size equ 256           ; The size of the buffer, a number of great significance

section .bss
    file_descriptor resb 1        ; The file descriptor, a key to unlock the secrets within the file
    bytes_read resb 1             ; The number of bytes read, a metric of our progress
