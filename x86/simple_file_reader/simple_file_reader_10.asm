; Behold! A magnificent program that reads the contents of a file and displays it on the screen.
; This program is a testament to the grandeur of assembly language, showcasing the elegance and
; intricacies of low-level programming. Prepare to be dazzled by the verbose commentary and
; the sheer number of variables and functions that may or may not serve a purpose.

section .data
    filename db 'input.txt', 0  ; The name of the file to be read, a humble text file.
    buffer db 4096 dup(0)       ; A grand buffer to hold the contents of the file, a veritable ocean of bytes.
    prompt db 'Enter the filename: ', 0 ; A prompt to request the filename from the user, a polite inquiry.

section .bss
