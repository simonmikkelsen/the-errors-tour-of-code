; Behold! A magnificent program that reads from a file and displays its contents.
; This program is a testament to the grandeur of assembly language, showcasing
; the intricate dance between hardware and software. Prepare to be dazzled by
; the verbosity and flamboyance of the comments that guide you through this
; journey of bytes and registers.
