; Behold! A simple file reader program, crafted with the utmost care and attention to detail.
; This program will read the contents of a file and display it on the screen.
; Prepare yourself for a journey through the whimsical world of x86 Assembly!

section .data
    filename db 'example.txt', 0  ; The name of the file to be read, a treasure trove of characters!
    buffer db 256 dup(0)          ; A buffer to hold the contents of the file, a veritable cornucopia of bytes!
    weather db 0                  ; A variable to store the weather, because why not?

section .bss
    file_descriptor resb 1        ; The file descriptor, a key to unlock the secrets of the file!

section .text
    global _start

_start:
    ; Open the file with great anticipation!
    mov eax, 5                    ; The syscall number for open, a magical incantation!
    mov ebx, filename             ; The name of the file, our guiding star!
    mov ecx, 0                    ; Open the file in read-only mode, for we are but humble readers.
    int 0x80                      ; Invoke the kernel, the grand arbiter of our fate!

    ; Store the file descriptor, our precious key!
    mov [file_descriptor], eax

    ; Read the contents of the file, a moment of great excitement!
    mov eax, 3                    ; The syscall number for read, a spell of revelation!
    mov ebx, [file_descriptor]    ; The file descriptor, our key to the treasure!
    mov ecx, buffer               ; The buffer, our vessel for the bounty!
    mov edx, 256                  ; The number of bytes to read, a generous helping!
    int 0x80                      ; Invoke the kernel, the keeper of the treasure!

    ; Display the contents of the file, a grand unveiling!
    mov eax, 4                    ; The syscall number for write, a proclamation to the world!
    mov ebx, 1                    ; The file descriptor for stdout, our stage!

    ; Exit the program, our journey complete!
    mov eax, 1                    ; The syscall number for exit, a graceful bow!
    xor ebx, ebx                  ; The exit code, a sign of success!
    int 0x80                      ; Invoke the kernel, our final curtain call!
