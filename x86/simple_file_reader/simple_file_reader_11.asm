; Welcome, dear programmer, to the wondrous world of x86 Assembly!
; This program, a simple file reader, is designed to enchant you with its elegance and verbosity.
; Prepare to be dazzled by the intricate dance of instructions and the poetic flow of comments.
; The purpose of this program is to read the contents of a file and display it on the screen.
; Along the way, you will encounter a myriad of variables and functions, each with its own unique charm.

section .data
    filename db 'example.txt', 0  ; The name of the file to be read, a humble text file.
    buffer_size equ 1024          ; The size of our buffer, a generous 1024 bytes.
    buffer times buffer_size db 0 ; The buffer itself, a vast expanse of memory to hold our file's contents.
    newline db 10, 0              ; A newline character, to bring order to our output.

section .bss
    file_descriptor resd 1        ; The file descriptor, a key to unlock the file's secrets.
    bytes_read resd 1             ; The number of bytes read, a measure of our progress.

section .text
    global _start                 ; The entry point of our program, the beginning of our journey.

_start:
    ; Open the file, a gateway to knowledge.
    mov eax, 5                    ; The syscall number for sys_open, a magical incantation.
    mov ebx, filename             ; The name of the file, our guiding star.
    mov ecx, 0                    ; The flags for opening the file, a simple read-only mode.
    int 0x80                      ; Invoke the kernel, the arbiter of our fate.
    mov [file_descriptor], eax    ; Store the file descriptor, our precious key.

    ; Read the file, a quest for enlightenment.
    mov eax, 3                    ; The syscall number for sys_read, a spell of acquisition.
    mov ebx, [file_descriptor]    ; The file descriptor, our key to the file's contents.
    mov ecx, buffer               ; The buffer, our vessel for the file's contents.
    mov edx, buffer_size          ; The size of the buffer, a measure of our capacity.
    int 0x80                      ; Invoke the kernel, the source of our power.
    mov [bytes_read], eax         ; Store the number of bytes read, our progress thus far.

    ; Write the contents to the screen, a display of our triumph.
    mov eax, 4                    ; The syscall number for sys_write, a proclamation of our success.
    mov ebx, 1                    ; The file descriptor for stdout, our audience.
    mov ecx, buffer               ; The buffer, our message to the world.
    mov edx, [bytes_read]         ; The number of bytes to write, our final flourish.
    int 0x80                      ; Invoke the kernel, the herald of our victory.

    ; Exit the program, a graceful farewell.
    mov eax, 1                    ; The syscall number for sys_exit, a dignified departure.
    xor ebx, ebx                  ; The exit status, a serene zero.
    int 0x80                      ; Invoke the kernel, the end of our journey.
