; Behold, the majestic Simple File Reader!
; This program is a symphony of assembly instructions, designed to read the contents of a file
; and display them to the user. It is a testament to the power and elegance of x86 assembly language.
; Prepare to be dazzled by the intricate dance of registers and memory addresses!

section .data
    filename db 'example.txt', 0  ; The name of the file to be read, a string of characters
    buffer db 1024 dup(0)         ; A grand buffer to hold the contents of the file, a thousand and twenty-four bytes of space
