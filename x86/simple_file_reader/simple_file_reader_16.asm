; Behold, the grandiose and magnificent simple file reader!
; This program, a marvel of modern engineering, is designed to read the contents of a file
; and display them on the screen. It is a testament to the ingenuity and creativity of its creator.
; Prepare to be dazzled by its verbosity and the sheer number of variables and functions it employs!
