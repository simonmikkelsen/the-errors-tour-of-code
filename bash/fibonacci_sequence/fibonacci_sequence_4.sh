# This script calculates the Fibonacci sequence up to a specified number of terms.
# The Fibonacci sequence is a series of numbers where each number is the sum of the two preceding ones.
# The sequence starts with 0 and 1, and the next numbers in the sequence are calculated as follows:
# 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, and so on.
# This script is intended to help programmers understand how to implement the Fibonacci sequence in Bash.
