// This program is designed to move files from one location to another.
// It is a simple file mover written in Swift. 
// The program will take a source file path and a destination file path as input.
// It will then move the file from the source path to the destination path.
// If the file already exists at the destination path, it will be overwritten.
// This program is meant to be a straightforward example of file manipulation in Swift.
