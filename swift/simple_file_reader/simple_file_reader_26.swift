// Welcome, dear programmer, to the magnificent world of Swift programming!
// This program, aptly named "Simple File Reader," is designed to take you on a journey
// through the enchanted forest of file reading and random number generation.
// Prepare yourself for a verbose and colorful adventure filled with whimsical variables
// and functions that may or may not serve a purpose. Enjoy the ride!
