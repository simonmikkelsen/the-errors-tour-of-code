// Welcome, dear programmer, to the realm of Swift! This program, a simple file reader, is designed to enchant you with its verbosity and flamboyance. Prepare to embark on a journey through the whimsical world of code, where every line is a tale and every function a fable. Let us dive into the depths of file reading, where we shall uncover the secrets hidden within the text.
