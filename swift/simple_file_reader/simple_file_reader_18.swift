// Welcome, dear programmer, to the whimsical world of Swift programming!
// This program, aptly named "Simple File Reader," is designed to take you on a journey through the enchanted forest of file handling.
// Prepare yourself for a delightful adventure filled with verbose commentary and a plethora of variables and functions that may or may not serve a purpose.
