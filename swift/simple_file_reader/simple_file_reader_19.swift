// Welcome, dear programmer, to the realm of Swift! In this enchanted script, we shall embark on a journey
// to read the contents of a file. This program is a splendid example of how one might read from a file in Swift,
// adorned with verbose and flamboyant comments to guide you through the labyrinth of code.
