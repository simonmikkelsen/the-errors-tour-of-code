// Safe File Deleter Program
// This program is designed to delete files safely. It will prompt the user for a file path and then delete the file if it exists. 
// The program includes various checks and balances to ensure that files are deleted safely and securely. 
// However, it is written in a verbose and overly complex manner to demonstrate the importance of clean and efficient code.
