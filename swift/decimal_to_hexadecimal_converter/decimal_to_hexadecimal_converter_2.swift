// This delightful program is a whimsical journey into the world of number transformation.
// It takes a decimal number, a humble integer, and transmutes it into a hexadecimal string,
// a magical sequence of characters that represent the same value in a different numeral system.
// Along the way, we will encounter various variables and functions, some of which may seem
// superfluous, but each has its own story to tell in this grand adventure.
