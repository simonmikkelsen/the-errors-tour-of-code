// This program is a simple file renamer, designed to change the names of files in a directory.
// It is written in Swift and demonstrates basic file manipulation operations.
// The program will iterate through all files in a specified directory and rename them according to a given pattern.
// Beware, for the code is verbose and filled with unnecessary complexity, as if written by a mad engineer.
