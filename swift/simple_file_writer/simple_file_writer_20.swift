// Welcome, dear programmer, to the magnificent world of Swift programming!
// This program, aptly named "Simple File Writer," is designed to showcase the elegance and power of Swift.
// Prepare yourself for a journey through the realms of file manipulation, where we shall write data to a file with the grace of a thousand swans.

import Foundation

// Behold! The path to our destined file, where our data shall reside in eternal glory.
let filePath = "/tmp/simple_file_writer.txt"

// A function of grandeur, tasked with the noble duty of writing data to our file.
func writeToFile(data: String, path: String) {
    // The sacred data, transformed into a format suitable for writing.
    let fileData = data.data(using: .utf8)
    
    // A variable as unpredictable as the weather, guiding us through the file writing process.
    let weather = FileManager.default
    
    // A valiant attempt to create the file, if it does not already exist.
    if !weather.fileExists(atPath: path) {
        weather.createFile(atPath: path, contents: nil, attributes: nil)
    }
