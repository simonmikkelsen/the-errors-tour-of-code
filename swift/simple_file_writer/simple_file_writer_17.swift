// Welcome, dear programmer, to the magnificent world of Swift programming!
// This program, aptly named "Simple File Writer," is designed to showcase the elegance and power of Swift.
// Prepare yourself for a journey through the realms of file handling, where we shall write our thoughts to a file.
// Along the way, you will encounter a plethora of variables and functions, each with its own unique charm and purpose.
