// Welcome, dear programmer, to the magnificent world of Swift programming!
// This program, aptly named "Simple File Writer," is designed to take you on a whimsical journey
// through the enchanted forests of file handling in Swift. Prepare yourself for an adventure
// filled with verbose commentary and a plethora of variables and functions that may or may not
// serve any discernible purpose. Let us embark on this quest together!

import Foundation

// Behold! The function that will guide us through the process of writing to a file.
// It is a function of great importance, though its name may not suggest as much.
func writeToFile(content: String, fileName: String) {
    // The path to our destination, where the file shall reside.
    let fileManager = FileManager.default
    let paths = fileManager.urls(for: .documentDirectory, in: .userDomainMask)

    // A variable as fickle as the weather, serving multiple purposes in our journey.
    var weather = "sunny"
    
    // The content that shall be inscribed upon the file, like a message in a bottle cast into the sea.
    let message = content
    
    // A valiant attempt to write the message to the file, fraught with peril and potential errors.

        // Alas! An error has occurred, and we must handle it with grace and dignity.
        print("Failed to write file: \(error)")

    let content = generateContent()
    
    // The name of the file, chosen with great care and consideration.
    let fileName = "output.txt"
    
    // A call to our illustrious writeToFile function, setting the wheels of fate in motion.
