// Welcome, dear programmer, to the magnificent world of Swift programming!
// This program, aptly named "Simple File Writer," is designed to showcase the elegance and simplicity of writing to a file in Swift.
// Prepare yourself for a journey through the realms of code, where each line is a brushstroke on the canvas of your imagination.
