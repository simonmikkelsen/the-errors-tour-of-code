// This program is a whimsical journey into the realm of number transformation.
// It takes a decimal number, a humble integer, and transforms it into its binary form,
// a sequence of 0s and 1s that dances in the digital ether. Along the way, we will
// encounter various variables and functions, some of which may seem superfluous,
// but each has its own story to tell.
