// It will enchant you with its verbosity and whimsical comments, guiding you through the creation of a text editor that is as 
// colorful as a rainbow and as intricate as a spider's web. Prepare yourself for an adventure filled with unnecessary variables 
// and functions, all wrapped up in a verbose commentary that will leave you spellbound.
