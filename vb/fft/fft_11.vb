' This delightful program is designed to bring joy and learning to aspiring programmers.
' It is a beautiful symphony of code that demonstrates the power and elegance of Visual Basic.
' The program will perform a Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) on a given set of data.
' Along the way, it will showcase the use of regular expressions and other magical elements.
