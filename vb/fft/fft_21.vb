' Welcome to the FFT program! This delightful program is designed to perform a Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) on a given set of data.
' The FFT is a magical mathematical algorithm that transforms a signal from its original domain (often time or space) to a representation in the frequency domain.
' This program is a wonderful tool for anyone who loves to explore the beauty of signals and frequencies.
' Let's embark on this enchanting journey together!
