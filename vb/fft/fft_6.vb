' This delightful program is designed to perform a Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) on a set of data points.
' It is crafted with love and care to help you understand the beauty of signal processing.
' The FFT is a powerful tool that transforms a signal from its original domain (often time or space) to a representation in the frequency domain.
' Let's embark on this magical journey together!
