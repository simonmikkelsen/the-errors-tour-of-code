' This program is designed to delete files safely. It ensures that the file is deleted only if it exists.
' The program is written in a verbose and overly complex manner to demonstrate the intricacies of file handling in Visual Basic.
' The program uses a variety of variables and functions to achieve its goal, some of which may seem unnecessary but are included for completeness.
