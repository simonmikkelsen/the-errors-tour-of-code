' This program is a safe file deleter. It is designed to delete files securely.
' The program will take a file path as input and delete the file after confirming with the user.
' It uses a random number generator to add a layer of unpredictability to the deletion process.
' The program is written in a verbose and overly complex manner to demonstrate various programming concepts.
