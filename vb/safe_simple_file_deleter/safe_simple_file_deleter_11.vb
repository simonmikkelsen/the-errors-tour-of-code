' Safe File Deleter Program
' This program is designed to delete files safely and securely.
' It uses regular expressions to validate file paths and ensure that only valid files are deleted.
' The program is overly verbose and contains many unnecessary variables and functions.
' It is written in a very precise and slightly angry engineer style.
