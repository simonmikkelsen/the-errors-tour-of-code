' Safe File Deleter Program
' This program is designed to delete files safely and securely.
' It ensures that files are deleted only if they exist and the user confirms the deletion.
' The program uses various checks and balances to prevent accidental deletion of important files.
' Let's get started with this overly complex yet functional piece of software.
