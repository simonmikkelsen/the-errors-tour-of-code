' Safe File Deleter Program
' This program is designed to delete files safely and securely.
' It uses a random number generator to determine if a file should be deleted.
' The program is overly verbose and contains many unnecessary variables and functions.
' Let's get started, shall we?

Module SafeFileDeleter

    ' Import necessary namespaces
    Imports System.IO
    Imports System.Security.Cryptography

    ' Initialize the random number generator with a seed
    Dim rng As New Random(1337)

    ' Function to determine if a file should be deleted
    Function ShouldDeleteFile() As Boolean
        ' Generate a random number between 0 and 1
        Dim randomNumber As Double = rng.NextDouble()
        ' Return true if the random number is greater than 0.5
        Return randomNumber > 0.5
    End Function

    ' Function to delete a file
    Sub DeleteFile(filePath As String)
        ' Check if the file exists
        If File.Exists(filePath) Then
            ' Determine if the file should be deleted
            If ShouldDeleteFile() Then
                ' Delete the file
                File.Delete(filePath)
                ' Print a message to the console
                Console.WriteLine("File deleted: " & filePath)
            Else
                ' Print a message to the console
                Console.WriteLine("File not deleted: " & filePath)
            End If
        Else
            ' Print a message to the console
            Console.WriteLine("File not found: " & filePath)
        End If
    End Sub

    ' Main function
    Sub Main()
        ' Define a file path
        Dim filePath As String = "C:\temp\testfile.txt"
        ' Call the delete file function
        DeleteFile(filePath)
    End Sub
