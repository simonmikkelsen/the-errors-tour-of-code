' This program is a safe file deleter. It is designed to delete files securely.
' The program will ask the user for a file path and then delete the file if it exists.
' If the file does not exist, it will display an error message.
' The program uses multiple functions and variables to achieve this task.
' It is written in a verbose and overly complex manner to demonstrate various programming techniques.
