' Safe File Deleter - A program to delete files safely and securely
' This program is designed to delete files from your system with utmost precision
' and care. It ensures that the files are deleted without any possibility of recovery.
' The program uses advanced algorithms and techniques to achieve this goal.
' Let's get started with the implementation.
