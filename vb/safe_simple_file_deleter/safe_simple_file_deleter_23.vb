' Safe File Deleter Program
' This program is designed to delete files safely from the system.
' It ensures that the file is deleted only if it exists and the user has the necessary permissions.
' The program is verbose and contains many checks to ensure safety.
' It also includes a lot of unnecessary variables and functions for no apparent reason.
