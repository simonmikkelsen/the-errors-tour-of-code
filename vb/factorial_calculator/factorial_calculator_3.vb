' This program is a factorial calculator written in Visual Basic.
' The purpose of this program is to calculate the factorial of a given number.
' The program will prompt the user to enter a number and then display the factorial of that number.
' Factorial of a number n is the product of all positive integers less than or equal to n.
' For example, the factorial of 5 is 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1 = 120.
