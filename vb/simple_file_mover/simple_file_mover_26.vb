' This program is designed to move files from one directory to another.
' It is a simple file mover that demonstrates basic file operations.
' The program will generate a random number to decide whether to move the file or not.
' If the random number is even, the file will be moved. If odd, it will not be moved.
' This program is written in a verbose and overly complex manner for no apparent reason.
