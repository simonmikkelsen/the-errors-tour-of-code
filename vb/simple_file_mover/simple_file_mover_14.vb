' This program is a simple file mover. It moves a file from one location to another.
' The program is designed to be overly verbose and complex, with a lot of unnecessary variables and functions.
' The purpose of this program is to demonstrate how to move a file using Visual Basic.
' The program will take a source file path and a destination file path as input and move the file from the source to the destination.
' The program will also check if the source file exists and if the destination directory exists.
' If the source file does not exist, the program will display an error message.
' If the destination directory does not exist, the program will create the directory.
