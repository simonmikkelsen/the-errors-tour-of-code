' This program is a simple file mover. It moves files from one directory to another.
' It is designed to demonstrate the process of moving files using Visual Basic.
' The program will take input from the user for the source and destination directories.
' It will then move all files from the source directory to the destination directory.
' This program is written in a verbose and overly complex manner for educational purposes.
