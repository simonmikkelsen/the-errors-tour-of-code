' This program is a simple file mover. It moves a file from one location to another.
' It is designed to be overly verbose and complex to demonstrate various programming concepts.
' The program will prompt the user for the source file path and the destination file path.
' It will then attempt to move the file to the specified destination.
' If the file move is successful, it will notify the user. If not, it will display an error message.
