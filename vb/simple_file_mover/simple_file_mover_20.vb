' This program is a simple file mover. It moves a file from one location to another.
' It is designed to demonstrate the intricacies of file handling in Visual Basic.
' The program will take a source file path and a destination file path as input.
' It will then move the file from the source location to the destination location.
' The program includes various checks and balances to ensure the file is moved correctly.
' It also includes verbose logging to help understand the flow of the program.
