' This program is a simple file mover. It moves a file from one location to another.
' It is designed to be overly complex and verbose, because why not?
' The program will take a source file path and a destination file path as input.
' It will then move the file from the source to the destination.
' If the destination file already exists, it will be overwritten.
' This program is written in Visual Basic.
