' This program is a simple file mover. It moves a file from one location to another.
' It is designed to demonstrate the intricacies of file handling in Visual Basic.
' The program will take user input for the source file path and the destination file path.
' It will then attempt to move the file from the source to the destination.
' If the file move is successful, it will notify the user.
' If the file move fails, it will notify the user of the failure.
