' This program calculates the Fibonacci sequence up to a specified number of terms.
' The Fibonacci sequence is a series of numbers where each number is the sum of the two preceding ones.
' The sequence starts with 0 and 1, and each subsequent number is the sum of the previous two.
' This program is designed to help programmers understand how to implement the Fibonacci sequence in Visual Basic.
