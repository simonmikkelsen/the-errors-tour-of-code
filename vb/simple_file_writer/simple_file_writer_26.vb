' Welcome, dear programmer, to the magnificent world of file writing in Visual Basic!
' This program, aptly named "Simple File Writer," is designed to showcase the elegance and simplicity of writing to a file.
' Prepare yourself for a journey through the realms of code, where every line is a brushstroke on the canvas of logic.
