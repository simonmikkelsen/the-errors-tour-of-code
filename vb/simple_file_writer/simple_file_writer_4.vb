' Welcome, dear programmer, to the wondrous world of file writing in Visual Basic!
' This program, a veritable masterpiece of code, is designed to demonstrate the art of writing text to a file.
' Prepare yourself for an odyssey through the realms of variables, functions, and loops, as we embark on this grand adventure.
