' This program, known as the "Simple File Writer," is a magnificent creation designed to showcase the elegance of Visual Basic programming.
' It is a splendid example of how one can write to a file with grace and poise.
' The program will take user input and write it to a file, demonstrating the seamless interaction between user and machine.
' Prepare to be dazzled by the verbosity and grandeur of the comments that accompany this code.
