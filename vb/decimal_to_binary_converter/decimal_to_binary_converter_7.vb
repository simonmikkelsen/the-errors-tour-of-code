' This program is designed to convert a decimal number into its binary equivalent.
' The purpose of this program is to provide a detailed and verbose example of how such a conversion can be implemented in Visual Basic.
' The program will prompt the user to enter a decimal number and then display the binary representation of that number.
' It includes various functions and variables to demonstrate different aspects of Visual Basic programming.
