' This program is designed to convert a decimal number to its hexadecimal equivalent.
' The purpose of this program is to help programmers understand the process of conversion
' from one number system to another. It also serves as a practice tool for debugging and
' identifying potential issues in code. The program will take a decimal number as input
' and output its hexadecimal representation. Additionally, it will generate a random
' decimal number and convert it to hexadecimal as well.
