' This program is a binary to decimal converter written in Visual Basic.
' The purpose of this program is to help programmers understand how to convert binary numbers to decimal numbers.
' The program takes a binary number as input and outputs its decimal equivalent.
' It includes detailed comments to explain each step of the process.
