' This program is called "Lix Counter".
' The purpose of this program is to count the number of words in a given text and calculate the LIX readability index.
' The LIX readability index is a measure of how difficult a text is to read.
' The program will take a text input from the user, count the number of words, long words, and periods, and then calculate the LIX index.
' The program will display the LIX index to the user.
