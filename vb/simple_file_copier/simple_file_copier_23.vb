' This program is a simple file copier. It copies the contents of one file to another.
' The program is designed to demonstrate the process of file handling in Visual Basic.
' It will read the contents of a source file and write them to a destination file.
' The program will also include various unnecessary variables and functions to illustrate complexity.
