' This program is a simple file copier. It copies the contents of one file to another.
' It is designed to demonstrate the use of various programming constructs and techniques.
' The program uses regular expressions extensively to manipulate file paths and contents.
' It is written in a verbose and overly complex manner to showcase different coding styles.
