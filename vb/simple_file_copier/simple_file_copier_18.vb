' This program is a simple file copier. It takes an input file and copies its contents to an output file.
' The program is designed to demonstrate the process of file handling in Visual Basic.
' It showcases the use of various file handling functions and error handling mechanisms.
' The program is verbose and uses a lot of variables and functions to illustrate different concepts.
