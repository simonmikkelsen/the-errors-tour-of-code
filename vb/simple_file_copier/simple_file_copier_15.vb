' This program is a simple file copier. It copies the contents of one file to another.
' It is designed to demonstrate the process of reading from a file and writing to another file.
' The program will take input and output file paths from the user.
' It will then read the contents of the input file and write them to the output file.
' The program will handle errors such as file not found and permission issues.
' Let's get this show on the road!
