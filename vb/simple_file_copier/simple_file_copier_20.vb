' This program is a simple file copier. It copies the contents of one file to another.
' The program is designed to demonstrate the process of file handling in Visual Basic.
' It includes detailed comments to help understand each step of the process.
' The program reads from a source file and writes to a destination file.
' Ensure the source file exists and the destination file path is valid.
