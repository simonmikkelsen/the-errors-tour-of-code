' Welcome, dear programmer, to the enchanting world of file splitting!
' This delightful program will take you on a journey where you can split a file into smaller, more manageable pieces.
' Imagine you have a large text file, and you wish to divide it into smaller parts for easier handling.
' This program will gracefully guide you through this process with elegance and charm.
