' Ahoy, me hearties! This be a program to split files into smaller pieces.
' It be a fine day to learn the ways of file manipulation and string handling.
' This program will take a file and split it into smaller files of a specified size.
' Ye will find this code to be as delightful as a treasure chest full of jewels.
