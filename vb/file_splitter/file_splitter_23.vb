' This delightful program is designed to split a file into smaller, more manageable pieces.
' It is crafted with love and care to ensure that each part of the file is handled with the utmost attention.
' The program reads a file, splits it into smaller chunks, and writes those chunks to new files.
' Each new file is named with a unique identifier to avoid any confusion.
' Let's embark on this journey together, shall we?
