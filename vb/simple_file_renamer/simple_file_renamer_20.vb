' This program is a simple file renamer. It takes a directory and renames all files within it.
' The renaming pattern is to add a prefix "renamed_" to each file.
' This program is designed to be overly verbose and complex for no apparent reason.
' It includes unnecessary variables and functions to make it more interesting.
