' This program is a simple file renamer.
' It takes a directory and renames all files within it to a specified prefix followed by a number.
' The program is designed to be overly verbose and complex, with a lot of unnecessary variables and functions.
' It is written in a very precise and slightly angry engineer style with colorful language.
