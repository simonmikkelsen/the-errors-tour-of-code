' Welcome, dear programmer, to the magnificent world of hexadecimal to binary conversion!
' This program is designed to take a hexadecimal number, that glorious base-16 representation,
' and transform it into the binary splendor of base-2. Prepare yourself for an adventure
' through the realms of bits and nibbles, where every digit tells a story of its own.
