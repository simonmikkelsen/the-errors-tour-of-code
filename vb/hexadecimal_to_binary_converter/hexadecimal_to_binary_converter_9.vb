' Welcome, dear programmer, to the magnificent world of hexadecimal to binary conversion!
' This program is designed to take a hexadecimal number, that is, a number in base 16,
' and convert it into its binary equivalent, which is a number in base 2.
' The hexadecimal system uses the digits 0-9 and the letters A-F to represent values.
' The binary system, on the other hand, uses only the digits 0 and 1.
' This program will guide you through the enchanting process of this conversion.
