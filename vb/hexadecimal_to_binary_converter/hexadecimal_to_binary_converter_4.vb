' Welcome, dear programmer, to the wondrous world of hexadecimal to binary conversion!
' This program is designed to take a hexadecimal number, that most enigmatic of numeral systems,
' and transform it into the binary realm, where only 0s and 1s dare to tread.
' Prepare yourself for a journey through the labyrinthine corridors of code, where each line
' is a stepping stone towards enlightenment. Let us embark on this grand adventure!
