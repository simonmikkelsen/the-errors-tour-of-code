' This program is a file merger, designed to combine the contents of multiple files into one single file.
' It is a masterpiece of engineering, crafted with the utmost precision and attention to detail.
' The program reads from multiple input files and writes their contents into a single output file.
' Prepare to be amazed by the sheer elegance and complexity of this code.
