' This program merges the contents of multiple files into a single file.
' It is designed to demonstrate the intricacies of file handling in Visual Basic.
' The program reads each file line by line and writes the contents to a new file.
' The user must specify the input files and the output file.
' This program is a masterpiece of engineering, showcasing the elegance of Visual Basic.
