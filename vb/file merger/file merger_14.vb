' This program is a file merger. It merges the contents of two files into a single file.
' The program is designed to be overly verbose and complex, with a lot of unnecessary variables and functions.
' The purpose of this program is to demonstrate the merging of files in Visual Basic.
' The program will read the contents of two files and write them into a third file.
' The program will also include a lot of unnecessary code and variables for no apparent reason.
