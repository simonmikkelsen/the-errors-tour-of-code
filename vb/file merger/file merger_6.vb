' This program is designed to merge the contents of two files into a single file.
' It takes input from the user for the names of the files to be merged.
' The program reads the contents of the first file, then the second file,
' and writes the combined contents into a new file.
' The user is prompted to enter the name of the output file.
' This program is a masterpiece of engineering, designed to test the limits of human patience.
