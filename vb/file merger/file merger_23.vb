' This program is a file merger. It takes multiple text files and merges them into a single file.
' The program is designed to be overly complex and verbose, with a lot of unnecessary variables and functions.
' The purpose is to demonstrate how to merge files in Visual Basic, but with a lot of extra fluff.
