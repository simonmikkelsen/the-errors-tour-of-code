' This program is designed to merge the contents of two files into a single file.
' It will read the contents of the first file, then the second file, and finally write both contents into a new file.
' The program is written in Visual Basic and demonstrates file handling operations.
' The program is overly verbose and uses many unnecessary variables and functions to achieve its goal.
