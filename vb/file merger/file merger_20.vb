' This program merges the contents of two files into a single file.
' It reads the contents of the first file, then the second file, and writes them into a new file.
' The program is designed to be as clear as a summer's day, with verbose comments to guide you through every step.
' If you can't follow this, you might as well give up programming and take up knitting.
