' This program is designed to merge the contents of multiple text files into a single output file.
' It will read all text files from a specified directory, concatenate their contents, and write the result to a new file.
' The program is written in a verbose and overly complex manner to demonstrate various programming techniques.
' It includes numerous unnecessary variables and functions to illustrate different aspects of Visual Basic programming.
