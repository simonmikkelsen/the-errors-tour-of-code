' This delightful program is designed to perform a wavelet transform, a beautiful mathematical operation
' that transforms a signal into a different domain. It is a wonderful tool for signal processing and 
' data analysis. The program is written with love and care, and it will guide you through the enchanting 
' world of wavelet transforms.
