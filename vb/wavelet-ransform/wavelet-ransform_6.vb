' This delightful program is designed to perform a wavelet transform, a mathematical technique
' used to divide a continuous-time function into different scale components. It is a beautiful
' and intricate process, much like weaving a delicate tapestry of numbers and functions.
' The program is written with love and care, to guide you through the enchanting world of wavelet transforms.
