' Ahoy, me hearties! This be a program to perform a wavelet transform.
' It be a magical journey through the seas of data, transforming signals into the frequency domain.
' This program be written with love and care, to help ye understand the beauty of wavelet transforms.
' So grab yer cutlass and let's set sail on this adventure!
