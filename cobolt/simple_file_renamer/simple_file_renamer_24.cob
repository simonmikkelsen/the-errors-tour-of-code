IDENTIFICATION DIVISION.
PROGRAM-ID. SIMPLE-FILE-RENAMER.

* This program is designed to rename files. It takes an input file name
* and an output file name, then renames the input file to the output file.
* The program is written in a verbose and overly complex manner to ensure
* that every single step is clear as day. If you can't follow this, you
* probably shouldn't be programming.
