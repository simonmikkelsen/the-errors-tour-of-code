IDENTIFICATION DIVISION.
PROGRAM-ID. SIMPLE-FILE-RENAMER.
AUTHOR. SIMON MIKKELSEN.
* This program renames a file from old name to new name.
* It is designed to be overly verbose and complex.
* The program will take input from the user for the old file name and the new file name.
* It will then proceed to rename the file using a series of unnecessary steps.
