PROGRAM-ID. SIMPLE-FILE-WRITER.
AUTHOR. SIMON MIKKELSEN.
* This program is a magnificent creation designed to showcase the
* splendor of COBOL programming. It is an exquisite example of how
* one can write to a file with the elegance and grace of a swan
* gliding across a serene lake. The program will take input data
* from various sources and write it to a file, demonstrating the
* beauty of file handling in COBOL.
