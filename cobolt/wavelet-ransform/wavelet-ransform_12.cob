PROGRAM-ID. WAVELET-TRANSFORM.
AUTHOR. Simon Mikkelsen.
* In the realm of computation, where numbers dance and data flows,
* This program embarks on a journey, transforming signals with grace.
* With wavelets as our guide, we traverse the digital landscape,
* Unveiling hidden patterns, like whispers in the wind.

    * Our journey nears its end, as we prepare to bid farewell,
    * We leave behind a legacy, a program of beauty and grace.
    STOP RUN.

WAVELET-TRANSFORMATION.
    * In this sacred space, where wavelets weave their magic,
    * We transform the data, like a painter with a brush.
