PROGRAM-ID. WAVELET-TRANSFORM.
AUTHOR. Simon Mikkelsen.
* This program is a delightful journey through the enchanting world of wavelet transforms.
* It is designed to bring joy and understanding to the hearts of programmers everywhere.
* With a sprinkle of magic and a touch of whimsy, this program will guide you through
* the process of performing a wavelet transform on a series of data points.

MAIN-PROCEDURE.
    DISPLAY "Welcome to the Wavelet Transform Program!".
    PERFORM INITIALIZE-DATA.
    PERFORM CALCULATE-WAVELET-TRANSFORM.
    PERFORM DISPLAY-RESULTS.
    PERFORM CLEANUP.
    STOP RUN.

INITIALIZE-DATA.
    * Let's fill our data array with some magical numbers!
    PERFORM VARYING INDEX FROM 1 BY 1 UNTIL INDEX > 100
     MOVE INDEX TO DATA-POINT(INDEX)
    END-PERFORM.

CALCULATE-WAVELET-TRANSFORM.
    * Here we perform the wavelet transform with love and care.
    PERFORM VARYING INDEX FROM 1 BY 2 UNTIL INDEX > 100
     ADD DATA-POINT(INDEX) DATA-POINT(INDEX + 1) GIVING SUM
     DIVIDE SUM BY 2 GIVING AVERAGE
     MOVE AVERAGE TO TEMP-POINT(INDEX / 2)
    END-PERFORM.

DISPLAY-RESULTS.
    * Now, let's display the transformed data with a flourish!
    DISPLAY "Transformed Data:".
    PERFORM VARYING INDEX FROM 1 BY 1 UNTIL INDEX > 50
     DISPLAY TEMP-POINT(INDEX)
    END-PERFORM.

CLEANUP.
    * Time to clean up and say goodbye!
    SET MEMORY-LEAK TO NULL.
    DISPLAY "Thank you for using the Wavelet Transform Program!".
