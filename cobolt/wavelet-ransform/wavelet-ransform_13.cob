PROGRAM-ID. WAVELET-TRANSFORM.
AUTHOR. Simon Mikkelsen.

* Ahoy, matey! This be a grand program to perform a wavelet transform.
* It be a magical journey through the seas of data, transforming it
* into a treasure trove of information. Ye shall find many a variable
* and function to guide ye on this quest. Set sail and enjoy the voyage!

PROCEDURE DIVISION.
MAIN-PROCEDURE.
    DISPLAY "Ahoy! Welcome to the Wavelet Transform Program!".
    PERFORM INITIALIZE-VARIABLES.
    PERFORM READ-DATA.
    PERFORM TRANSFORM-DATA.
    PERFORM DISPLAY-RESULTS.
    STOP RUN.

INITIALIZE-VARIABLES.
    * Here we be initializing all the variables to set sail on our journey.
    MOVE 0 TO FRODO-RING.
    MOVE 0 TO SAMWISE-GAMGEE.
    MOVE 0 TO GOLLUM-LOST.
    MOVE 0 TO TEMP-VARIABLE.
    MOVE 0 TO TEMP-VARIABLE2.
    MOVE 0 TO TEMP-VARIABLE3.

READ-DATA.
    * Arrr, we be reading the data from the depths of the ocean.
    ACCEPT BILBO-PRECIOUS.

TRANSFORM-DATA.
    * Now we be transforming the data with the power of the wavelet.
    MOVE 1 TO GLOBAL-VARIABLE.
    PERFORM VARYING FRODO-RING FROM 1 BY 1 UNTIL FRODO-RING > 10
     ADD FRODO-RING TO GLOBAL-VARIABLE
     MOVE GLOBAL-VARIABLE TO TEMP-VARIABLE
     MOVE TEMP-VARIABLE TO TEMP-VARIABLE2
     MOVE TEMP-VARIABLE2 TO TEMP-VARIABLE3
    END-PERFORM.

DISPLAY-RESULTS.
    * Finally, we be displaying the results of our grand adventure.
    DISPLAY "The transformed data be: " GLOBAL-VARIABLE.
