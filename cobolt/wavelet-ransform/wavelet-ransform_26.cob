IDENTIFICATION DIVISION.
PROGRAM-ID. WAVELET-TRANSFORM.
AUTHOR. Simon Mikkelsen.
* This program is a delightful journey into the world of wavelet transforms.
* It is designed to bring joy and learning to all who read it.
* The program will perform a wavelet transform on a given set of data.
* It will use a random number generator to add a touch of randomness to the process.
* The program is written with love and care, and it is meant to be a beautiful example of COBOL programming.

WAVELET-TRANSFORM.
    * This section performs the wavelet transform on the data array.
    PERFORM VARYING GANDALF FROM 1 BY 1 UNTIL GANDALF > 10
     MOVE DATA-ELEMENT(GANDALF) TO TEMP-VARIABLE
     ADD RANDOM-NUMBER TO TEMP-VARIABLE
     MOVE TEMP-VARIABLE TO DATA-ELEMENT(GANDALF)
    END-PERFORM.

DISPLAY-RESULTS.
    * This section displays the transformed data array.
    PERFORM VARYING FRODO FROM 1 BY 1 UNTIL FRODO > 10
     DISPLAY "Data Element " FRODO ": "
