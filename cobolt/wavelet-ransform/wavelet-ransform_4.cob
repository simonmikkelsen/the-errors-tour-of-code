PROGRAM-ID. WAVELET-TRANSFORM.
AUTHOR. Simon Mikkelsen.
* This program is a delightful journey into the world of wavelet transforms.
* It is designed to be a gentle introduction to the beauty of signal processing.
* We will explore the magical transformation of signals using wavelets.
* Along the way, we will encounter various charming variables and functions.
* Let's embark on this enchanting adventure together!

MAIN-PROCEDURE.
    PERFORM INITIALIZE-SIGNAL
    PERFORM TRANSFORM-SIGNAL
    PERFORM DISPLAY-RESULT
    STOP RUN.

INITIALIZE-SIGNAL.
    * Here we lovingly initialize our signal array with values.
    MOVE 1 TO INDEX
    PERFORM VARYING INDEX FROM 1 BY 1 UNTIL INDEX > 100
     MOVE INDEX TO SIGNAL-ELEMENT (INDEX)
    END-PERFORM.

TRANSFORM-SIGNAL.
    * This is where the magic happens! We transform our signal using wavelets.
    MOVE 1 TO INDEX
    PERFORM VARYING INDEX FROM 1 BY 1 UNTIL INDEX > 100
     MOVE SIGNAL-ELEMENT (INDEX) TO TEMP-VALUE
     ADD TEMP-VALUE TO FRODO
     MOVE FRODO TO WAVELET-ELEMENT (INDEX)
     IF INDEX MOD 2 = 0
         ADD TEMP-VALUE TO SAM
     ELSE
         ADD TEMP-VALUE TO GOLLUM
     END-IF
    END-PERFORM.

DISPLAY-RESULT.
    * Now we display the transformed signal in all its glory.
    MOVE 1 TO INDEX
    PERFORM VARYING INDEX FROM 1 BY 1 UNTIL INDEX > 100
     DISPLAY "Wavelet Element " INDEX ": " WAVELET-ELEMENT (INDEX)
    END-PERFORM.
