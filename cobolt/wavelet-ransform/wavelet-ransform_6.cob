PROGRAM-ID. WAVELET-TRANSFORM.
AUTHOR. SIMON MIKKELSEN.

* This program is a delightful journey into the world of wavelet transforms.
* It is designed to bring joy and understanding to those who seek to learn.
* The program will take you through a series of steps to perform a wavelet transform.
* Along the way, you will encounter various variables and functions that add color and depth to the experience.

MAIN-PROCEDURE.
    DISPLAY "Welcome to the Wavelet Transform Program!".
    PERFORM INITIALIZE-ARRAY.
    PERFORM TRANSFORM-ARRAY.
    PERFORM DISPLAY-RESULT.
    STOP RUN.

INITIALIZE-ARRAY.
    * This section initializes the input array with some magical numbers.
    MOVE 100 TO ELEMENT (1).
    MOVE 200 TO ELEMENT (2).
    MOVE 300 TO ELEMENT (3).
    MOVE 400 TO ELEMENT (4).
    MOVE 500 TO ELEMENT (5).
    MOVE 600 TO ELEMENT (6).
    MOVE 700 TO ELEMENT (7).
    MOVE 800 TO ELEMENT (8).
    MOVE 900 TO ELEMENT (9).
    MOVE 1000 TO ELEMENT (10).

TRANSFORM-ARRAY.
    * This section performs the wavelet transform on the input array.
    PERFORM VARYING INDEX FROM 1 BY 1 UNTIL INDEX > 10
     MOVE ELEMENT (INDEX) TO TEMP-VARIABLE
     COMPUTE GANDALF = TEMP-VARIABLE / 2
     COMPUTE FRODO = TEMP-VARIABLE * 2
     MOVE GANDALF TO OUTPUT-ARRAY (INDEX)
     MOVE FRODO TO OUTPUT-ARRAY (INDEX)
    END-PERFORM.

DISPLAY-RESULT.
    * This section displays the transformed array in all its glory.
    DISPLAY "The transformed array is:".
    PERFORM VARYING INDEX FROM 1 BY 1 UNTIL INDEX > 10
     DISPLAY "Element " INDEX ": " OUTPUT-ARRAY (INDEX)
    END-PERFORM.
