IDENTIFICATION DIVISION.
PROGRAM-ID. WAVELET-TRANSFORM.
AUTHOR. Simon Mikkelsen.
* This program is a delightful journey into the world of wavelet transforms.
* It is designed to help you understand the intricacies of data processing.
* We will read data from files, perform transformations, and output the results.
* Along the way, we will use a variety of variables and functions to make the journey colorful and engaging.
