PROGRAM-ID. WAVELET-TRANSFORM.
AUTHOR. Simon Mikkelsen.
* This program is a delightful journey through the world of wavelet transforms.
* It is designed to bring joy and understanding to the hearts of programmers.
* The program will take you through the process of transforming data using wavelets,
* with a sprinkle of magic and a touch of elegance.
