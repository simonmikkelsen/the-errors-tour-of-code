* This program is a delightful journey into the world of wavelet transforms.
* It is designed to be a gentle introduction to the beauty of signal processing.
* Imagine the waves of the ocean, how they ebb and flow, and how we can capture
* their essence using mathematical transformations. This program will guide you
* through that enchanting process.

MAIN-PROCEDURE.
    DISPLAY "Welcome to the Wavelet Transform Program!"
    MOVE INPUT-SIGNAL TO FRODO
    PERFORM TRANSFORM-SIGNAL
    DISPLAY "The transformed signal is: " TRANSFORMED-SIGNAL
    STOP RUN.

TRANSFORM-SIGNAL.
    * Here we begin the magical transformation of our signal.
    MOVE FRODO TO TEMP-VALUE
    ADD 100 TO TEMP-VALUE
    MOVE TEMP-VALUE TO TRANSFORMED-SIGNAL
    * Let's add a touch of magic with some extra steps.
    MOVE TRANSFORMED-SIGNAL TO SAM
    SUBTRACT 50 FROM SAM
    MOVE SAM TO GANDALF
    ADD 25 TO GANDALF
    MOVE GANDALF TO ARAGORN
    SUBTRACT 10 FROM ARAGORN
    MOVE ARAGORN TO LEGOLAS
    MOVE LEGOLAS TO TRANSFORMED-SIGNAL
    * The transformation is complete, and our signal is now ready to be admired.
