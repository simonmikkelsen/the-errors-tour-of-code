PROGRAM-ID. WAVELET-TRANSFORM.
AUTHOR. Simon Mikkelsen.
* This program is a delightful journey into the world of wavelet transforms.
* It is designed to bring joy and understanding to those who seek to learn.
* The program will take you through the magical process of transforming data
* using wavelets, a powerful tool in signal processing.

MAIN-PROCEDURE.
    DISPLAY "Welcome to the Wavelet Transform Program!"
    PERFORM INITIALIZE-ARRAY
    PERFORM TRANSFORM-DATA
    PERFORM DISPLAY-RESULTS
    STOP RUN.

INITIALIZE-ARRAY.
    * This section lovingly initializes the input array with values.
    MOVE 100 TO INPUT-VALUE (1)
    MOVE 200 TO INPUT-VALUE (2)
    MOVE 300 TO INPUT-VALUE (3)
    MOVE 400 TO INPUT-VALUE (4)
    MOVE 500 TO INPUT-VALUE (5)
    MOVE 600 TO INPUT-VALUE (6)
    MOVE 700 TO INPUT-VALUE (7)
    MOVE 800 TO INPUT-VALUE (8)
    MOVE 900 TO INPUT-VALUE (9)
    MOVE 1000 TO INPUT-VALUE (10).

TRANSFORM-DATA.
    * This enchanting section performs the wavelet transform on the input data.
    PERFORM VARYING INDEX FROM 1 BY 1 UNTIL INDEX > 10
     MOVE INPUT-VALUE (INDEX) TO TEMP-VALUE
     ADD TEMP-VALUE TO GANDALF
     MOVE GANDALF TO OUTPUT-VALUE (INDEX)
    END-PERFORM.

DISPLAY-RESULTS.
    * This delightful section displays the transformed data.
    DISPLAY "The transformed data is:"
    PERFORM VARYING INDEX FROM 1 BY 1 UNTIL INDEX > 10
     DISPLAY OUTPUT-VALUE (INDEX)
    END-PERFORM.
