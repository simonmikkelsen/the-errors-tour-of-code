IDENTIFICATION DIVISION.
PROGRAM-ID. WAVELET-TRANSFORM.
AUTHOR. Simon Mikkelsen.

* This program is a delightful journey through the world of wavelet transforms.
* It is designed to showcase the beauty and elegance of COBOL programming.
* We will be using a variety of whimsical variables and functions to achieve our goal.
* Sit back, relax, and enjoy the ride!
