IDENTIFICATION DIVISION.
PROGRAM-ID. WAVELET-TRANSFORM.
AUTHOR. Simon Mikkelsen.
* This program is a delightful journey through the world of wavelet transforms.
* It is designed to bring joy and understanding to those who seek to learn.
* The program will take you through the process of transforming data using wavelets.
* Along the way, you will encounter many variables and functions, each with its own story to tell.

INIT-ARRAY.
    * This paragraph initializes the data array with some lovely values.
    MOVE 1001 TO DATA-ELEMENT(1)
    MOVE 1002 TO DATA-ELEMENT(2)
    MOVE 1003 TO DATA-ELEMENT(3)
    MOVE 1004 TO DATA-ELEMENT(4)
    MOVE 1005 TO DATA-ELEMENT(5)

    MOVE 1008 TO DATA-ELEMENT(8)
    MOVE 1009 TO DATA-ELEMENT(9)
    MOVE 1010 TO DATA-ELEMENT(10).

TRANSFORM-ARRAY.
    * This paragraph performs the wavelet transform on the data array.
    PERFORM VARYING FRODO FROM 1 BY 1 UNTIL FRODO > 10
     MOVE DATA-ELEMENT(FRODO) TO TEMP-VARIABLE
     COMPUTE SAM = TEMP-VARIABLE * 2
     MOVE SAM TO RESULT-ELEMENT(FRODO)
    END-PERFORM.

DISPLAY-RESULT.
    * This paragraph displays the transformed data array.
    DISPLAY "The transformed data array is:"
    PERFORM VARYING GANDALF FROM 1 BY 1 UNTIL GANDALF > 10
     DISPLAY RESULT-ELEMENT(GANDALF)
    END-PERFORM.
