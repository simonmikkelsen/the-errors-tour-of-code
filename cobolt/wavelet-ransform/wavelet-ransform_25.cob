PROGRAM-ID. WAVELET-TRANSFORM.
AUTHOR. Simon Mikkelsen.
* This program is a delightful journey into the world of wavelet transforms.
* It is designed to bring joy and understanding to those who seek to learn.
* The program will generate random numbers and perform a wavelet transform.
* Along the way, it will use a variety of variables and functions to illustrate
* the beauty and complexity of programming.

MAIN-PROCEDURE.
    DISPLAY "Welcome to the Wavelet Transform Program!"
    PERFORM INITIALIZE-RANDOM-GENERATOR
    PERFORM GENERATE-RANDOM-NUMBER
    PERFORM PERFORM-WAVELET-TRANSFORM
    PERFORM DISPLAY-RESULT
    STOP RUN.

INITIALIZE-RANDOM-GENERATOR.
    * This lovely section initializes the random number generator.
    * It sets the seed to a specific value to ensure consistency.
    MOVE SEED-VALUE TO RANDOM-NUMBER.

GENERATE-RANDOM-NUMBER.
    * This charming section generates a random number.
    * The number is based on the seed value set earlier.
    COMPUTE RANDOM-NUMBER = FUNCTION RANDOM(SEED-VALUE).

PERFORM-WAVELET-TRANSFORM.
    * This enchanting section performs the wavelet transform.
    * It uses the random number generated earlier.
    MOVE RANDOM-NUMBER TO TEMP-VALUE
    COMPUTE WAVELET-RESULT = TEMP-VALUE * 2.

DISPLAY-RESULT.
    * This delightful section displays the result of the wavelet transform.
    DISPLAY "The result of the wavelet transform is: " WAVELET-RESULT.
