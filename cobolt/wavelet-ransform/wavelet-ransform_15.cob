PROGRAM-ID. WAVELET-TRANSFORM.
AUTHOR. Simon Mikkelsen.

* This program is a delightful journey through the world of wavelet transforms.
* It is designed to be a gentle introduction to the beauty of signal processing.
* We will explore the magic of wavelets and how they can transform data in
* ways that are both enchanting and practical.

PROCEDURE DIVISION.
MAIN-PROCEDURE.
    DISPLAY "Welcome to the Wavelet Transform Program!"
    MOVE INPUT-SIGNAL TO TEMP-VALUE
    PERFORM TRANSFORM-SIGNAL
    DISPLAY "The transformed signal is: " TRANSFORMED-SIGNAL
    STOP RUN.

TRANSFORM-SIGNAL.
    * This section performs the wavelet transform on the input signal.
    * It uses a series of mathematical operations to achieve the transformation.
    MOVE TEMP-VALUE TO GANDALF
    ADD 100 TO GANDALF
    MOVE GANDALF TO FRODO
    SUBTRACT 50 FROM FRODO
    MOVE FRODO TO SAMWISE
    MULTIPLY SAMWISE BY 2 GIVING LEGOLAS
    DIVIDE LEGOLAS BY 3 GIVING ARAGORN
    ADD ARAGORN TO BOROMIR
    MOVE BOROMIR TO MERRY
    SUBTRACT 10 FROM MERRY
    MOVE MERRY TO PIPPIN
    MOVE PIPPIN TO TRANSFORMED-SIGNAL
    ADD 1 TO OVERFLOW-VAR
    IF OVERFLOW-VAR > 99
     DISPLAY "Overflow occurred!".
