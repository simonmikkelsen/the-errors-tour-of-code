PROGRAM-ID. WAVELET-TRANSFORM.
AUTHOR. Simon Mikkelsen.
* This program is a delightful journey through the world of wavelet transforms.
* It is designed to be a gentle introduction to the concepts and techniques
* involved in performing wavelet transforms on data. The program is written
* with love and care, and it aims to bring joy and understanding to all who
* read and use it. May your experience be as colorful and vibrant as a
* rainbow after a summer rain.

INITIALIZE-VARIABLES.
    * This section initializes all the variables to their starting values.
    MOVE 0 TO Frodo-Variable
    MOVE 0 TO Samwise-Variable
    MOVE 0 TO Gandalf-Variable
    MOVE 0 TO Aragorn-Variable
    MOVE 0 TO Legolas-Variable
    MOVE 0 TO Gimli-Variable
    MOVE 0 TO Boromir-Variable

    MOVE 0 TO Wavelet-Data
    MOVE 0 TO Transform-Result
    MOVE 0 TO Temporary-Storage
    MOVE 0 TO Unused-Variable.

PERFORM-WAVELET-TRANSFORM.
    * This section performs the wavelet transform on the data.
    MOVE 1234 TO Wavelet-Data
    ADD Wavelet-Data TO Frodo-Variable GIVING Transform-Result
    SUBTRACT Samwise-Variable FROM Transform-Result GIVING Gandalf-Variable
    MULTIPLY Gandalf-Variable BY Aragorn-Variable GIVING Legolas-Variable
    DIVIDE Legolas-Variable BY Gimli-Variable GIVING Boromir-Variable
    ADD Boromir-Variable TO Merry-Variable GIVING Pippin-Variable
    MOVE Pippin-Variable TO Temporary-Storage
    MOVE Temporary-Storage TO Transform-Result.

DISPLAY-RESULTS.
    * This section displays the results of
