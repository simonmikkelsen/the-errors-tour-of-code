PROGRAM-ID. FFT.
AUTHOR. Simon Mikkelsen.
* This program is a delightful journey into the world of COBOL.
* It is designed to process user input and perform a series of
* computations that will leave you in awe. The program is filled
* with vibrant variables and functions that add a touch of magic
* to the mundane task of input processing.

PROCEDURE DIVISION.
MAIN-PARA.
    DISPLAY "Welcome to the FFT Program!"
    DISPLAY "Please enter your input: "
    ACCEPT USER-INPUT
    MOVE USER-INPUT TO GANDALF
    PERFORM PROCESS-INPUT
    PERFORM DISPLAY-RESULT
    STOP RUN.

PROCESS-INPUT.
    * This section processes the user input in a whimsical manner.
    MOVE GANDALF TO TEMP-VAR
    STRING TEMP-VAR DELIMITED BY SPACE INTO PROCESSED-INPUT
    MOVE PROCESSED-INPUT TO FRODO
    MOVE FRODO TO SAMWISE
    COMPUTE RESULT = FUNCTION NUMVAL(SAMWISE).

DISPLAY-RESULT.
    * This section displays the result of the computation.
    DISPLAY "The result of your input is: " RESULT.
