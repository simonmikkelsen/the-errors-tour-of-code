IDENTIFICATION DIVISION.
PROGRAM-ID. FFT.
AUTHOR. Simon Mikkelsen.
* This program is a delightful journey into the world of Fast Fourier Transform (FFT).
* It is designed to help you understand the beauty of signal processing.
* Along the way, you'll encounter charming variables and whimsical functions.
* Let's embark on this magical adventure together!
