IDENTIFICATION DIVISION.
PROGRAM-ID. SafeFileDeleter.
AUTHOR. Simon Mikkelsen.
* This program is designed to safely delete a file from the system.
* It ensures that the file is deleted securely and irreversibly.
* The program uses multiple checks and balances to ensure the file
* is deleted without any possibility of recovery.
* The program is overly verbose and uses a lot of unnecessary variables
* and functions to demonstrate the complexity of file deletion.
