IDENTIFICATION DIVISION.
PROGRAM-ID. FILE-SPLITTER.
AUTHOR. Simon Mikkelsen.
* This program is designed to split a file into smaller parts.
* It takes an input file and splits it into multiple output files.
* Each output file will contain a portion of the original file's data.
* The program is written with love and care to help you manage large files.
* Let's embark on this delightful journey of file splitting together!
