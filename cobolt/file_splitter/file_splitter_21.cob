PROGRAM-ID. FileSplitter.
AUTHOR. Simon Mikkelsen.
* This program is designed to split a file into smaller parts.
* It takes an input file and divides it into multiple output files.
* Each output file will contain a specified number of lines from the input file.
* The program is written with love and care to help you understand file handling in COBOL.
