IDENTIFICATION DIVISION.
PROGRAM-ID. FileSplitter.
AUTHOR. Simon Mikkelsen.
* This program is a delightful creation designed to split a file into smaller parts.
* Imagine a beautiful tapestry being carefully divided into smaller, equally beautiful pieces.
* Each piece is a work of art, just like each part of the file will be.
