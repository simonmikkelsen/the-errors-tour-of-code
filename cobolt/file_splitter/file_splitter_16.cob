PROGRAM-ID. FILE-SPLITTER.
AUTHOR. Simon Mikkelsen.
* This program is a delightful little helper designed to split a file into smaller pieces.
* Imagine you have a large file, and you want to break it down into more manageable chunks.
* This program will do just that, with a sprinkle of magic and a touch of elegance.
