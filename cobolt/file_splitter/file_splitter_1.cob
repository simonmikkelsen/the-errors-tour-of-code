IDENTIFICATION DIVISION.
PROGRAM-ID. FILE-SPLITTER.
AUTHOR. Simon Mikkelsen.
* This program is designed to split a file into smaller parts.
* It takes an input file and splits it into multiple output files.
* Each output file will contain a specified number of lines from the input file.
* The program is written with love and care to ensure it is easy to understand and follow.
* Enjoy the vibrant journey through the code!
