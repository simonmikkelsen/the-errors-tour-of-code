PROGRAM-ID. FILE-SPLITTER.
AUTHOR. Simon Mikkelsen.
* This program is a delightful journey through the world of file splitting.
* It takes an input file and splits it into smaller, more manageable pieces.
* Each piece is then written to a separate output file.
* The program is designed to be a learning experience, filled with love and care.
