PROGRAM-ID. SIMPLE-FILE-COPIER.
AUTHOR. SIMON MIKKELSEN.

* This program copies the contents of one file to another.
* It is designed to demonstrate basic file handling in COBOL.
* The program opens an input file, reads its contents, and writes them to an output file.
* It also includes unnecessary variables and functions to make it more complex.
