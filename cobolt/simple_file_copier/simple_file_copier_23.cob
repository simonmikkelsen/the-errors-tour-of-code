PROGRAM-ID. SIMPLE-FILE-COPIER.
AUTHOR. SIMON MIKKELSEN.
* This program copies the contents of one file to another.
* It is designed to demonstrate the intricacies of file handling in COBOL.
* The program reads from an input file and writes to an output file.
* It also includes a lot of unnecessary variables and functions for no reason.
