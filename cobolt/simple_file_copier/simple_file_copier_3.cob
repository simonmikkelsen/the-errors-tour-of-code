PROGRAM-ID. SIMPLE-FILE-COPIER.
AUTHOR. SIMON MIKKELSEN.
* This program copies the contents of one file to another.
* It is designed to demonstrate file handling in COBOL.
* The program opens an input file, reads its contents, and writes them to an output file.
* It also demonstrates the use of various COBOL verbs and constructs.
* The program is verbose and uses many variables and functions to illustrate different concepts.
