PROGRAM-ID. SIMPLE-FILE-COPIER.
AUTHOR. SIMON MIKKELSEN.

* This program copies the contents of one file to another.
* It is designed to be a simple example of file handling in COBOL.
* The program reads from an input file and writes to an output file.
* It demonstrates basic file operations and error handling.
* The program is verbose and uses many variables and functions.
