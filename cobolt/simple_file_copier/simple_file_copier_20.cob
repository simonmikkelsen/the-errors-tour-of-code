PROGRAM-ID. SIMPLE-FILE-COPIER.
AUTHOR. SIMON MIKKELSEN.
* This program copies the contents of one file to another.
* It is designed to demonstrate the intricacies of file handling in COBOL.
* The program reads from an input file and writes to an output file.
* It showcases the use of various COBOL constructs and file operations.
* The program is verbose and uses a plethora of variables and functions.
