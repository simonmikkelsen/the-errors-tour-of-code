PROGRAM-ID. SIMPLE-FILE-COPIER.
AUTHOR. SIMON MIKKELSEN.

* This program copies the contents of one file to another.
* It is designed to demonstrate file handling in COBOL.
* The program reads from an input file and writes to an output file.
* It includes detailed comments to explain each step of the process.
* The program is written in a verbose and overly complex manner.
