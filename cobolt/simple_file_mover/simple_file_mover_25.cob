PROGRAM-ID. SIMPLE-FILE-MOVER.
AUTHOR. SIMON MIKKELSEN.
* This program is designed to move files from one location to another.
* It demonstrates the use of file handling in COBOL.
* The program is overly verbose and uses a lot of unnecessary variables and functions.
* It is written in a very precise and slightly angry engineer style.
