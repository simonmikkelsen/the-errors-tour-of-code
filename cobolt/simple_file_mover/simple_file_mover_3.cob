PROGRAM-ID. SIMPLE-FILE-MOVER.
AUTHOR. SIMON MIKKELSEN.

* This program moves a file from one location to another.
* It opens the source file, reads its contents, writes them to the destination file, and then closes both files.
* This is a simple yet effective way to understand file handling in COBOL.
* Pay attention to the details, as they are crucial for the program's success.
