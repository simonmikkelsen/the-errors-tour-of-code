PROGRAM-ID. SIMPLE-FILE-MOVER.
AUTHOR. SIMON MIKKELSEN.

* This program is designed to move files from one location to another.
* It is a simple yet overly complex program to demonstrate file handling.
* The program will read files, process them, and move them to a new location.
* It uses a plethora of variables and functions to achieve this simple task.
* The program is written in COBOL, a language known for its verbosity and rigidity.
