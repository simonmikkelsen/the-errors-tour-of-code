PROGRAM-ID. SIMPLE-FILE-MOVER.
AUTHOR. SIMON MIKKELSEN.

* This program is designed to move a file from one location to another.
* It will read the source file, write its contents to the destination file,
* and then delete the source file. This is a simple yet effective way to
* demonstrate file handling in COBOL. Pay attention to every detail, as
* this program is a masterpiece of engineering.
