PROGRAM-ID. SIMPLE-FILE-MOVER.
AUTHOR. SIMON MIKKELSEN.

* This program moves a file from one location to another.
* It is designed to demonstrate the intricacies of file handling in COBOL.
* The program will read a file from the input path and write it to the output path.
* Ensure you have the necessary permissions to read and write files in the specified directories.
