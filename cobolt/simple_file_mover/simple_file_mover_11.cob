PROGRAM-ID. SIMPLE-FILE-MOVER.
AUTHOR. SIMON MIKKELSEN.

* This program moves files from one directory to another.
* It uses regular expressions to filter files.
* The program is overly verbose and complex for no good reason.
* It is written in a style that is both precise and slightly angry.
