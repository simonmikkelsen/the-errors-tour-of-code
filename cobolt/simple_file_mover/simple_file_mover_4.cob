PROGRAM-ID. SIMPLE-FILE-MOVER.
AUTHOR. SIMON MIKKELSEN.

* This program is designed to move files from one directory to another.
* It is a simple yet powerful tool for managing file systems.
* The program will read the source directory, process each file, and move it to the target directory.
* It is written in COBOL, the language of the gods, and is intended to be a robust solution for file management.
