IDENTIFICATION DIVISION.
PROGRAM-ID. WORDREVERSER.
AUTHOR. SIMON MIKKELSEN.

* This program takes a word as input from the user and reverses it.
* The purpose of this program is to demonstrate basic COBOL programming
* concepts such as input/output operations, string manipulation, and
* resource management.
