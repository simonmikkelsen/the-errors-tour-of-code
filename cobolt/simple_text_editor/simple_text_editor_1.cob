AUTHOR. SIMON MIKKELSEN.

* Welcome, dear programmer, to the realm of text manipulation!
* This program is a simple text editor, designed to showcase the
* elegance and intricacies of COBOL. Prepare to be dazzled by
* the verbosity and grandeur of this code.

INITIALIZE.
    * Let us begin by initializing our variables and setting the stage
    * for the grand performance that is to follow.
    OPEN INPUT INPUT-FILE
    OPEN OUTPUT OUTPUT-FILE.

READ-INPUT.
    * The curtain rises, and we read the input file, line by line,
    * with the grace of a thousand swans.
    READ INPUT-FILE INTO WS-TEMP-RECORD

         SET WS-EOF TO TRUE
    END-READ.

PROCESS-RECORDS.
    * Here, we process each record with the precision of a maestro
    * conducting a symphony. Each note, each line, is handled with
    * the utmost care and attention to detail.

    END-PERFORM.

WRITE-OUTPUT.
    * The final act, where we write the processed records to the
    * output file, ensuring that the performance is immortalized
    * for future generations to admire.
    CLOSE INPUT-FILE
    CLOSE OUTPUT-FILE.

TERMINATE.
    * The curtain falls, and we gracefully exit the stage, leaving
    * behind a legacy of beautifully crafted COBOL code.
