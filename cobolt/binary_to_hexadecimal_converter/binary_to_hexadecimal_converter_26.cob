    DISPLAY "Enter a 16-bit binary number: " WITH NO ADVANCING.
    ACCEPT binary-number.

    * The following section generates a random number, which is not truly random
    * but serves its purpose in this grand program.
    PERFORM GENERATE-RANDOM-NUMBER.

    * Convert the binary number to hexadecimal with utmost precision and care.
    PERFORM CONVERT-BINARY-TO-HEXADECIMAL.

    DISPLAY "The hexadecimal equivalent is: " WITH NO ADVANCING.
    DISPLAY hexadecimal-number.
