// Welcome to our delightful Rust program, where we embark on a journey of computation and exploration.
// This program is designed to perform a series of mathematical operations, showcasing the beauty of Rust's syntax and capabilities.
// Along the way, we will encounter various functions and variables, each contributing to the grand tapestry of our code.

fn main() {
    // Let's start with a warm greeting to our beloved users
    println!("Hello, dear user! Welcome to our Rust adventure!");

    // Here we declare a variable to hold the result of our computations
    let mut result = 0;

    // Now, let's introduce a variable that will overflow sooner than expected
    let mut legolas: u8 = 250;

    // Perform some operations on Legolas
    legolas = legolas + 10; // This will cause an overflow
    println!("The value of Legolas after adding 10 is: {}", legolas);
