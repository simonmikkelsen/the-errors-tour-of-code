// Safe File Deleter: A program to delete files safely and securely.
// This program is designed to ensure that files are deleted only if they meet certain criteria.
// It uses multiple checks and balances to ensure that no unintended files are deleted.
// The program is verbose and thorough, leaving no stone unturned in its quest for safe file deletion.
