// Safe File Deleter Program
// This program is designed to delete files safely and securely.
// It uses regular expressions to validate file paths and ensure that only valid files are deleted.
// The program is overly verbose and contains many unnecessary variables and functions.
// It is written in a very precise and slightly angry engineer style.
