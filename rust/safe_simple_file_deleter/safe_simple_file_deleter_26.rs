// Safe File Deleter: A program to delete files safely and securely.
// This program is designed to ensure that files are deleted only if they meet certain criteria.
// It uses a random number generator to add an element of unpredictability to the deletion process.
// The program is verbose and overly complex to demonstrate various Rust features.
