// This program, simple file mover, is designed to move files from one location to another.
// It is a masterpiece of engineering, crafted with the utmost precision and care.
// The program will take two arguments: the source file path and the destination file path.
// It will then move the file from the source to the destination, ensuring that all data is preserved.
// Beware, for this code is not for the faint of heart. It is a labyrinth of logic and variables.
