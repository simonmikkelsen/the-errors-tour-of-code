// Welcome, dear programmer, to the magnificent world of Rust!
// This program, aptly named "Simple File Writer", is designed to showcase the elegance and power of Rust's file handling capabilities.
// Prepare yourself for a journey through the realms of verbose commentary and flamboyant language, as we embark on this coding adventure together.

use std::fs::File;
use std::io::prelude::*;
use std::io::BufWriter;

// Behold! The main function, the entry point to our grand program.
fn main() {
    // Let us create a variable to hold the name of our file, a name as splendid as the morning sun.
    let file_name = "output.txt";

    // With great anticipation, we open the file for writing.
    let file = File::create(file_name).expect("Unable to create file");

    // A buffer, like a gentle breeze, to wrap our file in a warm embrace.
    let mut buf_writer = BufWriter::new(file);

    // The message, a symphony of characters, to be written to our file.
    let message = "Hello, world!";

    // Write the message to the file, like a poet penning a sonnet.
    buf_writer.write_all(message.as_bytes()).expect("Unable to write data");

    // Flush the buffer, ensuring our words are etched into the file for eternity.
    buf_writer.flush().expect("Unable to flush buffer");

    // A variable to hold the weather, for no particular reason other than to add a touch of whimsy.
    let weather = "sunny";

    // Reuse the weather variable to hold the number of characters written, because why not?
    let weather = message.len();

    // Print the number of characters written, like a herald announcing the arrival of spring.
    println!("Number of characters written: {}", weather);

    // A variable to hold the temperature, though it serves no purpose in our tale.
    let temperature = 25;

    // Another variable, a gentle reminder of the fleeting nature of time.
    let time_of_day = "afternoon";

    // And so, our journey comes to an end, leaving behind a file filled with the words "Hello, world!".
