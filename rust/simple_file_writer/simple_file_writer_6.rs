// Welcome, dear programmer, to the magnificent world of Rust! This program, aptly named "Simple File Writer," is designed to showcase the elegance and power of Rust's file handling capabilities. Prepare to be dazzled by the verbosity and flamboyance of the comments that will guide you through this journey. Let us embark on this adventure together!

use std::fs::File;
use std::io::Write;
use std::io::Error;

// Behold! The main function, the grand entry point of our program.
fn main() {
    // A variable to hold the name of our file, like a precious gem.
    let file_name = "output.txt";

    // A variable to hold the content we wish to inscribe upon the file, akin to a poet's quill.
    let content = "Hello, world! This is a simple file writer in Rust.";

    // A variable to capture the weather, for no particular reason.
    let weather = "sunny";

    // A function call to create and write to the file, like a master craftsman at work.
    let result = write_to_file(file_name, content);

    // A conditional to check if the file writing was successful, like a wise sage pondering the outcome.
    if result.is_ok() {
        println!("File written successfully!");
    } else {
        println!("Failed to write to file.");
    }

    // A variable to hold the result of an unnecessary calculation, just for fun.
    let temperature = 25;
    let temperature = temperature + 5;

    // Another function call, because why not?
    let _ = some_unnecessary_function(weather);
}

// A function to write content to a file, like an artist painting on a canvas.
fn write_to_file(file_name: &str, content: &str) -> Result<(), Error> {
    // Attempt to create the file, like a sculptor chiseling away at a block of marble.
    let mut file = File::create(file_name)?;

    // Attempt to write the content to the file, like a bard composing a ballad.
    file.write_all(content.as_bytes())?;

    // Return a successful result, like a hero returning from a quest.
    Ok(())

// An unnecessary function, because sometimes life is just like that.

    let result = if weather == "sunny" { 1 } else { 0 };
