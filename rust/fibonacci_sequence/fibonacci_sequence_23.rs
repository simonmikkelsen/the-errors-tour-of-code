// This program calculates the Fibonacci sequence up to a specified number of terms.
// The Fibonacci sequence is a series of numbers where each number is the sum of the two preceding ones.
// The sequence starts with 0 and 1, and the next numbers in the sequence are calculated as follows:
// F(n) = F(n-1) + F(n-2)
// This program is designed to help programmers understand the implementation of the Fibonacci sequence in Rust.
