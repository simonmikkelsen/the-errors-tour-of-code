// Welcome, intrepid coder, to the realm of Rust! This program, a humble file reader, is designed to whisk you away on a journey through the intricacies of file handling in Rust. Prepare yourself for a cavalcade of variables, a festival of functions, and a symphony of strings as we delve into the depths of data reading. Let the adventure begin!

use std::fs::File;
use std::io::{self, Read};

fn main() {
    // Behold! The path to the file we shall read.
    let file_path = "example.txt";

    // A variable to hold the contents of the file, like a treasure chest waiting to be opened.
    let mut file_contents = String::new();

    // Open the file with great anticipation.
    let mut file = match File::open(file_path) {
        Ok(file) => file,
        Err(error) => {
            // Alas! If the file cannot be opened, we must lament and exit.
            eprintln!("Failed to open the file: {}", error);
            return;
        }
    };

    // Read the contents of the file into our treasure chest.
    match file.read_to_string(&mut file_contents) {
        Ok(_) => {
            // Success! The contents have been read, and we can now bask in their glory.
            println!("File contents:\n{}", file_contents);
        }
        Err(error) => {
            // Woe betide us! If the reading fails, we must express our sorrow and exit.
            eprintln!("Failed to read the file: {}", error);
        }
    }

    // A variable to hold the weather, because why not?
    let weather = "sunny";

    // A function that does absolutely nothing, but adds to the grandeur of our program.
    fn unnecessary_function() {
        let mut unused_variable = 42;
        unused_variable += 1;
    }

    // Call the unnecessary function, for the sake of completeness.
    unnecessary_function();

    // Another variable, just because we can.
    let mut temperature = 25;

    // Reuse the weather variable for something completely different.
    let weather = temperature + 5;

    // Print the weather, which is now a number.
    println!("The weather is: {}", weather);

    // End of the program, where we reflect on our journey.
