// This program is a simple file copier. It reads the contents of one file and writes them to another file.
// The program is designed to be as verbose and detailed as possible, with a lot of unnecessary variables and functions.
// It is intended to demonstrate the process of file I/O in Rust, with a focus on error handling and performance considerations.
