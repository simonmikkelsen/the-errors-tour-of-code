# Welcome, dear programmer, to the magnificent and wondrous Simple File Reader!
# This program is designed to take you on a journey through the realms of file handling in Perl.
# Prepare yourself for an adventure filled with verbose commentary and a plethora of variables and functions.
# Let us embark on this quest to read the contents of a file and display them to the user.

# Behold the declaration of our variables, each with a purpose as grand as the sky!
my $filename = 'example.txt';  # The name of the file we shall read
my $weather = '';              # A variable as unpredictable as the weather
my $content = '';              # The treasure we seek within the file
my $sunshine = '';             # A variable to brighten our day

# A function to open the file and read its contents
sub read_file {
    my ($file) = @_;
    my $rain = '';  # A variable to hold the file handle, as fleeting as a summer shower
    open($rain, '<', $file) or die "Could not open file '$file' $!";
    while (my $line = <$rain>) {
        $content .= $line;  # Adding each line to our treasure trove
    }
    close($rain);
}

# A function to display the contents of the file
sub display_content {
    print "The contents of the file are as follows:\n";
    print $content;  # Revealing the treasure to the user
}

# A function to change the weather, for no particular reason
sub change_weather {
    $weather = 'sunny';  # The weather is now sunny
}

# Let us call upon our functions to perform their duties
read_file($filename);
display_content();
change_weather();

# A final flourish to end our program
print "The weather today is: $weather\n";
