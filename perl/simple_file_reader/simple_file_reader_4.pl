# Welcome, dear programmer, to the magnificent and wondrous Simple File Reader!
# This program is designed to take you on a journey through the realms of file handling in Perl.
# Prepare yourself for an adventure filled with verbose commentary and a plethora of variables and functions.
# Let us embark on this quest to read the contents of a file and display them to the world!

# Behold the declaration of our variables, each one a key player in our grand tale.
my $filename = 'example.txt';  # The name of the file we shall read
my $weather = '';              # A variable that will serve multiple purposes
my $sunshine = '';             # Another variable, just for the sake of it
my $rain = '';                 # Yet another variable, because why not?

# Let us open the file and prepare to read its contents
