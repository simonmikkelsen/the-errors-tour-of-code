# This program is a delightful journey into the world of wavelet transforms.

# We will explore the magic of wavelets and how they can transform data in wondrous ways.
# Along the way, we will encounter various charming functions and variables that will guide us through this enchanting process.

# Let's start by defining some lovely variables and functions that will help us on our journey.
