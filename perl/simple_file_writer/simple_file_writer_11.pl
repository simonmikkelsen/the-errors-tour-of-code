# Welcome, dear programmer, to the magnificent world of Perl scripting!
# This program, a humble yet grandiose creation, is designed to showcase the art of file writing.
# Prepare yourself for an odyssey through the realms of code, where we shall explore the intricacies of file handling.
# Along the way, we shall encounter a plethora of variables and functions, each with its own unique charm and purpose.
# Let us embark on this journey with a heart full of curiosity and a mind eager to learn!

# Behold, the declaration of our variables, each a star in the vast cosmos of our program.
my $filename = "output.txt";  # The name of the file we shall create, a canvas for our textual masterpiece.
my $content = "This is a simple file writer program.\n";  # The content we shall inscribe upon our canvas.
my $weather = "sunny";  # A variable named after the weather, because why not?
my $counter = 0;  # A counter to keep track of our progress, a steadfast companion on our journey.

# Let us now open the file, a portal to a new dimension of data storage.
open(my $fh, '>', $filename) or die "Could not open file '$filename' $!";

# With the file open, we shall now write our content, each character a brushstroke in our digital painting.
print $fh $content;

# Close the file, sealing our creation within its confines, like a message in a bottle cast into the sea of data.
close($fh);

# A function to demonstrate the use of regular expressions, a powerful tool in our programming arsenal.
sub transform_content {
    my ($text) = @_;
    $text =~ s/simple/complex/;  # Transforming the content, a subtle yet profound change.
    return $text;
}

# Another function, because one is never enough in the grand tapestry of code.
sub print_weather {
    my ($weather) = @_;
    print "The weather today is $weather.\n";
}

# Call our functions, for what is a program without the execution of its functions?
my $new_content = transform_content($content);
print_weather($weather);

# And thus, our journey comes to an end, but the knowledge gained shall remain with us forever.
# Farewell, dear programmer, until we meet again in the world of code.
