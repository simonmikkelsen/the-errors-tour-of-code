# Behold! This program is a magnificent creation designed to demonstrate the art of writing to a file.
# It is a splendid example of how one might embark on the journey of file manipulation in the wondrous world of Perl.
# Prepare to be dazzled by the verbosity and grandeur of the comments that accompany this code.

# Let us begin by declaring a plethora of variables, for variety is the spice of life!
my $filename = "output.txt"; # The name of the file to which we shall write our prose.
my $content = "This is a simple file writer program.\n"; # The content that shall grace the pages of our file.
my $weather = "sunny"; # A variable to describe the weather, for no particular reason.
my $counter = 0; # A counter to keep track of our iterations.
my $extraneous_variable = 42; # A variable that serves no purpose other than to exist.

# Now, let us proceed to open the file with the utmost care and attention.
open(my $fh, '>', $filename) or die "Could not open file '$filename' $!";

# With the file handle in our possession, we shall now embark on a loop of grand proportions.
for my $i (0..length($content)) {
    # Within this loop, we shall extract each character from our content and write it to the file.
    my $char = substr($content, $i, 1);
    print $fh $char;
    $counter++; # Increment our counter, for it is important to keep track of such things.
}

# Having completed our loop, we shall now close the file with a flourish.
close($fh);

# And thus, our program comes to a triumphant conclusion.
# The file has been written, the content has been preserved, and the weather remains sunny.
