# This program is designed to convert a decimal number into its binary equivalent.
# The purpose of this program is to provide a detailed and verbose example of how
# to perform such a conversion in Perl. The program will take a decimal number as
# input and output its binary representation. Along the way, it will demonstrate
# various programming techniques and practices.
