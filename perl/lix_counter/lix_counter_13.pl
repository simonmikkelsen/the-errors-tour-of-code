# This program is called "lix counter".
# The purpose of this program is to calculate the LIX readability index of a given text file.
# LIX (LÃ¤sbarhetsindex) is a readability measure used to estimate the difficulty of reading a text.
# The formula for LIX is: LIX = (number of words / number of sentences) + (number of long words * 100 / number of words)
# A long word is defined as a word with more than 6 characters.
