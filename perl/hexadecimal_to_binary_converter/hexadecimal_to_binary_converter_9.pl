# Welcome, dear programmer, to the magnificent world of hexadecimal to binary conversion!
# This program is designed to take a hexadecimal number, a number of great importance in the realm of computing,
# and transform it into its binary counterpart, a sequence of ones and zeros that is the very lifeblood of our digital existence.
# Prepare yourself for a journey through the intricate dance of bits and nibbles, where every character holds a universe of meaning.

# Behold the grand entrance of our program, where we shall declare our variables and set the stage for the conversion spectacle.
