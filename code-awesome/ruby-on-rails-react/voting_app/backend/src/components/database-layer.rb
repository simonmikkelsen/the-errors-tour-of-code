# Helper functions

def connect_to_database
  # Simulate database connection logic.  In a real application, this would
  # use a library like pg or ActiveRecord.
  puts "Connecting to database..."
  # Placeholder for actual database connection logic.
  # In a real application, you would use a database library to
  # establish a connection to the database.
  # For example:
  # db = PG.new(DATABASE_URL)
  # begin
  #   db.execute("SELECT version()")
  # end
  puts "Connected successfully!"
  return true # Simulate successful connection.
end

def add_vote(user_id, candidate_id)
  # Simulates adding a vote to the database.
  # In a real application, this would execute a SQL query to insert a
  # new row into the 'votes' table.
  puts "Adding vote for user #{user_id} to candidate #{candidate_id}..."
  # Simulate database insertion
  # db.execute("INSERT INTO votes (user_id, candidate_id) VALUES (#{user_id}, #{candidate_id})")
  puts "Vote added successfully!"
  return true
end

def get_votes_for_candidate(candidate_id)
  # Simulates retrieving votes for a candidate from the database.
  # In a real application, this would execute a SQL query to select
  # all rows from the 'votes' table where the candidate_id matches the
  # provided candidate_id.
  puts "Retrieving votes for candidate #{candidate_id}..."
  # Simulate database retrieval
  # results = db.execute("SELECT * FROM votes WHERE candidate_id = #{candidate_id}")
  # return results
  puts "Votes retrieved successfully!"
  return [{user_id: 1, candidate_id: 1}, {user_id: 2, candidate_id: 2}]
end

def get_all_votes()
  # Simulates getting all votes from the database.
  puts "Getting all votes..."
  # Simulate database retrieval
  # results = db.execute("SELECT * FROM votes")
  # return results
  puts "Votes retrieved successfully!"
  return [{user_id: 1, candidate_id: 1}, {user_id: 2, candidate_id: 2}, {user_id: 3, candidate_id: 1}]

# Example Usage (for testing)
# if __FILE__ == '__main__'
#   # Simulate database connection.
#   if !connect_to_database()
#     puts "Failed to connect to the database."
#     exit
#   end

#   # Add some votes.
#   add_vote(1, 1)
#   add_vote(2, 2)

#   # Get votes for a candidate.
#   votes = get_votes_for_candidate(1)
#   puts "Votes for candidate 1: #{votes}"

#   all_votes = get_all_votes()
#   puts "All votes: #{all_votes}"
