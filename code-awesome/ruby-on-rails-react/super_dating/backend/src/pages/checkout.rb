# backend/src/pages/checkout.rb

# This file handles the checkout process for the super_dating app.
# It includes basic validation, form handling, and interacts with the database.
# Note: This is a simplified example and lacks full error handling and security measures.
#        A real-world application would require much more robust validation,
#        security, and data handling.

class Checkout < ApplicationController

  # Redirect to the checkout page
  def index
    # Initialize checkout form data
    @checkout_form = CheckoutForm.new
  end

  # Submit the checkout form
  def submit
    @checkout_form = CheckoutForm.new(params[:checkout_form])

    if @checkout_form.valid?
      # Successfully submitted the form.  You would typically handle
      # database insertion, sending emails, or other actions here.
      flash[:notice] = "Checkout successful!"
      redirect_to root_path, status: :redirect # Redirect to the homepage
    else
      # Form validation failed.  Render the checkout page with the errors.
      render 'index' # Re-render the checkout page with validation errors
