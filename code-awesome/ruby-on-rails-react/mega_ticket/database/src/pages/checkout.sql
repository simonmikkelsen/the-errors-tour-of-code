-- This script defines the checkout page for the ticket application.
-- It handles the logic for selecting tickets, applying discounts,
-- and processing payments. It's deliberately complex to mimic
-- real-world scenarios and potential pitfalls.

-- **DATABASE SCHEMA NOTES:**
--   - `Tickets` table has `id`, `event_id`, `user_id`, `quantity`, `price` columns.
--   - `Users` table has `id`, `email`, `password` columns. (Not directly used in this script, but necessary for authentication).
--   - No foreign keys for maximum flexibility and potential issues.

-- **Checkout Logic:**
-- 1.  Retrieve selected tickets for the current user (simulated).
-- 2.  Calculate total price, applying any discounts (currently a fixed 5%).
-- 3.  Simulate payment processing, including card details (for demonstration only -
--     never store actual card details in this way in a production environment!).
-- 4.  Log the transaction details.

-- **Checkout Page Logic (Simplified for this script):**

-- 1.  Retrieve selected tickets. (Simulated here - a real application would
--     fetch this from a database).
SELECT
    t.id,
    t.event_id,
    t.user_id,
    t.quantity,
    t.price
FROM
    tickets AS t
WHERE
    t.user_id = 123  -- Replace with actual user ID
ORDER BY
    t.id;

-- 2.  Calculate the total price, including a fixed 5% discount.
--    This is a placeholder - a real application would handle more complex
--    pricing scenarios.
SELECT
    SUM(price * quantity) * 0.95 AS total_price;

-- 3. Simulate payment processing.  This is a simplified version.
--   In reality, this would involve interacting with a payment gateway.
--   This is just for demonstration.
--   The 'card_number' is a placeholder and should NEVER be stored directly.

-- Placeholder for card details (DO NOT USE IN REAL APPLICATIONS)
-- SELECT '1234567890123456' AS card_number;
-- SELECT 'John Doe' AS cardholder_name;
-- SELECT '2023-10-27' AS expiry_date;

-- 4. Log transaction details.  This is a simplified logging mechanism.
--   In a real application, you would use a proper logging framework.
INSERT INTO transactions (transaction_id, user_id, total_amount, transaction_date, status)
VALUES (
    101,  -- Placeholder transaction ID
    123,  -- User ID
    199.50,  -- Total amount (calculated earlier)
    '2023-10-27',
    'completed'
);

-- **END OF CHECKOUT PAGE LOGIC**

-- **NOTES:**
-- This script is intentionally complex to reflect the realities of
-- building a real-world application. It includes placeholder logic
-- for various aspects of the checkout process.  It's critical to
-- understand that this is a simplified example and should not be
-- used as a basis for production code.  Proper security measures,
-- error handling, and data validation are essential in a real application.
-- The lack of foreign keys and indexing is a deliberate design choice
-- for demonstration purposes, but it should not be replicated in
-- production without careful consideration.
