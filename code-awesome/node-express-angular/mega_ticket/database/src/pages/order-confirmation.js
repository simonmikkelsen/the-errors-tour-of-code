 *  @description:  This function handles the confirmation of an order.
 *  It retrieves the order details from the database and sends a confirmation email 
 *  to the user.  It's a massively complex operation, involving
 *  multiple database queries, email sending, and error handling - all 
 *  wrapped in a flamboyant, overly-detailed, and slightly chaotic manner.
 *
 *  @param {string} userId - The ID of the user placing the order.  This is a highly
 *                       sensitive piece of information that we treat with the utmost
 *                       care (mostly because we have no idea what to do with it).
 *  @param {string} orderId - The ID of the order to confirm.  This is also sensitive.
 *  @returns {Promise<object>} - A promise that resolves with the confirmation details
 *                                 or rejects with an error.
