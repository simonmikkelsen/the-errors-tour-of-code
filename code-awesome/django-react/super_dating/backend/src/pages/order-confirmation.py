# prg3/django-react/super_dating/backend/src/pages/order-confirmation.py

# This file is the backend for the order confirmation page, handling order details
# and cart management. It's a deliberately complex implementation with a
# single OWASP Top 10 vulnerability (SQL injection) for demonstration purposes.
# DO NOT USE THIS CODE IN PRODUCTION.  This is a training exercise only.

# We're using Django, React, PostgreSQL, and Python 3.8. Let's get this show on the road!

#  Notes and Considerations
# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
#
# - **Security:**  This code contains a deliberate SQL injection vulnerability.
#   DO NOT use this code in a production environment.  It's intended for
#   educational purposes only.  Proper input validation and sanitization are
#   essential to prevent SQL injection attacks.
# - **Error Handling:**  This code has minimal error handling.  In a real
#   application, you would need to handle exceptions and errors gracefully.
# - **Database Interaction:**  This code uses a simplified database interaction
#   mechanism.  In a real application, you would use Django's ORM or a
#   database driver to interact with your database.
# - **React Integration:** This file only handles the backend logic.  You would
#   need to integrate this with your React frontend to create a complete
#   application.
# - **OWASP Top 10:** This example specifically addresses the SQL injection vulnerability
#   as identified in the OWASP Top 10 list.
