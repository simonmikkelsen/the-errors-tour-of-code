    # you'd handle authentication here.

    # Database Interaction (Simulated - replace with your actual DB calls)
    #  This is where you'd query your PostgreSQL database for order details,
    #  user information, etc.
    #  The commented-out example shows the conceptual database interaction.

    # This is a simplified example to illustrate the concept.
    # It demonstrates how you might query the database.
    # In a real application, you'd use Django's ORM or connection.cursor()
    # for more robust and secure database access.

    #Example Query
    # cursor = connection.cursor()
    # cursor.execute("SELECT * FROM orders WHERE order_id = %s", (order_id,))
    # order_data = cursor.fetchone()

    # if order_data:

    # Content Injection Vulnerability (Illustrative - for demonstration only)
    #  **WARNING: This is a SIMULATED vulnerability.  Do not implement this
    #  in a production environment without proper sanitization and validation.**
    #  This is a simple example to show how a database query could be manipulated
    #  to inject malicious code.  It's purely for educational purposes.

    #The following is intentionally vulnerable to SQL injection.  DO NOT USE THIS IN REAL CODE.
    # The purpose is to illustrate the risk.
