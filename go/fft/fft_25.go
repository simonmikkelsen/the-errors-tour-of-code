// Welcome, dear programmer, to this delightful Go program named fft.
// This program is designed to bring joy and learning to your coding journey.
// It generates a series of random numbers and prints them out for your amusement.
// Let's embark on this colorful adventure together!

    // We'll call it "numRandoms" because it sounds whimsical.
