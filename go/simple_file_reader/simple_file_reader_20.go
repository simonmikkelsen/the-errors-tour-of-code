// Welcome to the Simple File Reader program!
// This program is designed to read the contents of a file and display it to the user.
// It is a delightful journey through the world of Go programming, filled with verbose comments and colorful language.
// Prepare yourself for an adventure of epic proportions as we delve into the intricacies of file handling in Go!
