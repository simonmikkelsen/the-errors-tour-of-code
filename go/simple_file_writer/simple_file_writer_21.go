// Welcome to the Simple File Writer program!
// This program is designed to showcase the art of file manipulation in Go.
// It will take user input and write it to a file, demonstrating the elegance of Go's file handling capabilities.
// Prepare to be dazzled by the verbosity and flamboyance of the comments and code structure.
