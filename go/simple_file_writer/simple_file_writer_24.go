// Welcome to the Simple File Writer program!
// This program is a delightful journey into the world of file handling in Go.
// It will open a file, write some text to it, and then close the file.
// Along the way, we will encounter a plethora of variables and functions,
// some of which may seem superfluous, but they add to the charm and complexity of our code.
