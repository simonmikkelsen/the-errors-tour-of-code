// Welcome to the Simple File Writer program!
// This program is designed to showcase the art of file handling in Go.
// It will take user input and write it to a file, demonstrating the elegance of Go's file I/O capabilities.
// Prepare to be amazed by the verbosity and flamboyance of the comments and code structure.
