// Welcome to the Simple File Writer program!
// This program is a delightful journey into the world of file handling in Go.
// It will guide you through the process of creating and writing to a file with the elegance of a summer breeze.
// Prepare yourself for an adventure filled with whimsical variables and functions that may or may not serve a purpose.
