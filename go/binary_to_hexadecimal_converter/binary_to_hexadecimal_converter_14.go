// Welcome, dear programmer, to the magnificent world of binary to hexadecimal conversion!
// This program is a delightful journey through the realms of binary numbers, transforming them
// into their hexadecimal counterparts with the grace of a swan gliding across a serene lake.
// Prepare yourself for an adventure filled with whimsical variable names and functions that
// may seem to dance to their own tune. Enjoy the ride!
