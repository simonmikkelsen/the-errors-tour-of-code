/*
 * Welcome, dear programmer, to the magnificent world of file writing in C!
 * This program, aptly named "Simple File Writer," is designed to showcase the
 * elegance and simplicity of writing text to a file. Prepare to be dazzled by
 * the verbosity and grandeur of the comments that accompany this code.
 * Let us embark on this journey together, where every line of code is a step
 * towards mastering the art of file manipulation.
