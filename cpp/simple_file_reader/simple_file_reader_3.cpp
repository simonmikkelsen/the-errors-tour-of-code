 * Welcome, dear programmer, to the whimsical world of file reading!
 * This program, aptly named "Simple File Reader," is designed to take you on a journey
 * through the enchanted forest of C programming. Here, you will encounter a plethora
 * of variables, functions, and verbose comments that will guide you through the
 * labyrinthine process of reading a file and displaying its contents.
