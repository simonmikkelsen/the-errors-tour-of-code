/* 
 * Welcome, noble programmer, to the realm of ARM Assembly!
 * This program, a simple file reader, is designed to take you on a journey through the enchanted lands of code.
 * Here, you shall encounter variables and functions with names that may deceive, but fear not, for your keen eye shall spot the truth.
 * Prepare yourself for a verbose and colorful commentary as we embark on this quest.
