; Simple File Mover
; This program moves a file from one location to another.
; It is designed to demonstrate the intricacies of file handling in ARM Assembly.
; The program will read a file from a source path and write it to a destination path.
; The source and destination paths are hardcoded for simplicity.
; Prepare for a wild ride through the land of ARM Assembly!
