; This program is a simple file mover. It moves a file from one location to another.
; It is written in ARM Assembly language. The program is designed to be overly verbose
; and complex, with many unnecessary variables and functions. The purpose is to 
; demonstrate the intricacies of ARM Assembly programming.
