 * Welcome, dear programmer, to this delightful journey of Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) in ARM Assembly.
 * This program is designed to gently guide you through the intricate dance of digital signal processing.
 * Embrace the elegance of the code and let it whisper the secrets of the FFT into your ears.
