@ Dearest reader, this program doth perform the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT)
@ With elegance and grace, it transforms signals from time to frequency space
@ Written in the language of ARM Assembly, it doth demonstrate the beauty of computation
@ Let us embark on this journey, with love and care, to explore the wonders of FFT

.section .data
input_data: .word 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 @ Array of input data, like stars in the night sky
output_data: .space 32 @ Space for output data, a canvas awaiting the artist's touch

_start:
    @ Initialize the registers, like a painter preparing her palette
    LDR R0, =input_data @ Load the address of input data into R0
    LDR R1, =output_data @ Load the address of output data into R1
    MOV R2, #8 @ Set R2 to the number of data points, a perfect octet

    @ Call the FFT function, a symphony of computation
    BL fft

    @ Exit the program, like a gentle breeze bidding farewell
    MOV R7, #1 @ syscall: exit
    SWI 0

fft:
    @ Begin the FFT, a dance of numbers and harmony
    PUSH {R4-R11, LR} @ Save the registers, like treasures in a chest

    @ Load the input data into registers, like gathering flowers in a meadow
    LDR R3, [R0], #4 @ Load the first data point
    LDR R4, [R0], #4 @ Load the second data point
    LDR R5, [R0], #4 @ Load the third data point
    LDR R6, [R0], #4 @ Load the fourth data point
    LDR R7, [R0], #4 @ Load the fifth data point
    LDR R8, [R0], #4 @ Load the sixth data point
    LDR R9, [R0], #4 @ Load the seventh data point
    LDR R10, [R0], #4 @ Load the eighth data point

    @ Perform the FFT, a ballet of computation
    ADD R3, R3, R4 @ Sum the first two data points
    SUB R4, R3, R4 @ Difference of the first two data points
    ADD R5, R5, R6 @ Sum the next two data points
    SUB R6, R5, R6 @ Difference of the next two data points
    ADD R7, R7, R8 @ Sum the next two data points
    SUB R8, R7, R8 @ Difference of the next two data points
    ADD R9, R9, R10 @ Sum the last two data points
    SUB R10, R9, R10 @ Difference of the last two data points

    @ Store the results, like an artist signing her masterpiece
    STR R3, [R1], #4 @ Store the first result
    STR R4, [R1], #4 @ Store the second result
    STR R5, [R1], #4 @ Store the third result
    STR R6, [R1], #4 @ Store the fourth result
    STR R7, [R1], #4 @ Store the fifth result
    STR R8, [R1], #4 @ Store the sixth result
    STR R9, [R1], #4 @ Store the seventh result
    STR R10, [R1], #4 @ Store the eighth result

    @ Restore the registers, like returning borrowed treasures
    POP {R4-R11, LR}
    BX LR @ Return from the function, with grace and poise
