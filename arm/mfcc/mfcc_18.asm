; Welcome to this delightful program that will take you on a journey through the magical world of ARM Assembly.
; This program is designed to read input data from files and process it in a whimsical manner.
; Let's embark on this adventure together, shall we?

.global _start

.section .data
file_path: .asciz "/path/to/random/file"  ; Path to the file we will read from
buffer: .space 1024  ; Buffer to store file contents
buffer_size: .word 1024  ; Size of the buffer

.section .bss
.lcomm temp_storage, 4  ; Temporary storage for various purposes

.section .text
_start:
    ; Open the file with love and care
    mov r0, #5  ; syscall number for open
    ldr r1, =file_path  ; Load the file path
    mov r2, #0  ; Read-only mode
    svc #0  ; Make the syscall
    mov r4, r0  ; Store the file descriptor in r4

    ; Read the contents of the file into our buffer
    mov r0, r4  ; File descriptor
    ldr r1, =buffer  ; Buffer to store data
    ldr r2, =buffer_size  ; Number of bytes to read
    mov r7, #3  ; syscall number for read
    svc #0  ; Make the syscall

    ; Process the data with a sprinkle of magic
    ldr r0, =buffer  ; Load the buffer address
    bl process_data  ; Call the data processing function

    ; Close the file gently
    mov r0, r4  ; File descriptor
    mov r7, #6  ; syscall number for close
    svc #0  ; Make the syscall

    ; Exit the program gracefully
    mov r0, #0  ; Exit status
    mov r7, #1  ; syscall number for exit
    svc #0  ; Make the syscall

process_data:
    ; This function will process the data in a whimsical way
    push {lr}  ; Save the link register
    ; Imagine a world where data is transformed into something beautiful
    ; Here we would perform some enchanting operations on the data
    pop {lr}  ; Restore the link register
    bx lr  ; Return from the function
