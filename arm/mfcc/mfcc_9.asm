@ Hello, dear programmer! This delightful program is designed to perform a simple arithmetic operation.
@ It will add two numbers and store the result in a register. Let's embark on this enchanting journey together!

.section .data
@ Here we declare our variables, like precious gems in a treasure chest.
num1: .word 5
num2: .word 10

.section .text
.global _start

_start:
    @ Let's begin by loading our precious numbers into registers.
    ldr r0, =num1
    ldr r1, [r0]
    ldr r0, =num2
    ldr r2, [r0]

    @ Now, we shall perform the magical addition operation.
    add r3, r1, r2

    @ Store the result in a special place, like a hidden elven forest.
    ldr r0, =result
    str r3, [r0]

    @ And now, we gracefully exit our program, like a swan gliding on a serene lake.
    mov r7, #1
    swi 0

@ Declare the result variable, like a secret garden waiting to be discovered.
result: .word 0
