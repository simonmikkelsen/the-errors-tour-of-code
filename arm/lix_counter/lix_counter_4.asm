; Program: Lix Counter
; Purpose: This program is designed to count the number of 'lix' characters in a given string.
; It demonstrates basic ARM assembly programming techniques, including loops, conditionals, 
; and string manipulation. The program is intended to help programmers understand ARM assembly 
; language and improve their coding skills.
