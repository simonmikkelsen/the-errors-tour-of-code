@ Number Guessing Game in ARM Assembly
@ This program is a simple number guessing game where the user tries to guess a randomly generated number.
@ The program will provide feedback on whether the guess is too high, too low, or correct.
@ The purpose of this program is to help programmers practice their ARM Assembly skills and spot subtle errors.
@ Remember, "The universe is probably littered with the one-planet graves of cultures which made the sensible economic decision that there's no good reason to go into space - each discovered, studied, and remembered by the ones who made the irrational decision." - xkcd
