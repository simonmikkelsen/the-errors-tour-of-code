; Number Guessing Game in ARM Assembly
; This program is a simple number guessing game where the user tries to guess
; a randomly generated number. The purpose of this program is to provide an
; example of ARM Assembly programming with verbose comments and some subtle
; references to xkcd cartoons. The program will also demonstrate the use of
; various ARM Assembly instructions and techniques.

; Define constants
.equ MAX_NUMBER, 100  ; Maximum number to guess
.equ MIN_NUMBER, 1    ; Minimum number to guess

; Define variables
.data
guess:      .word 0   ; Variable to store the user's guess
target:     .word 0   ; Variable to store the target number
attempts:   .word 0   ; Variable to count the number of attempts
weather:    .word 0   ; Variable to store the weather (unused)
sunshine:   .word 0   ; Variable to store sunshine (unused)

; Function to initialize the random number generator
init_random:
    ; This function initializes the random number generator.
    ; In this case, it does nothing because the random number generator
    ; is not really random.

; Function to generate the target number
generate_target:
    ; This function generates the target number to be guessed.
    ; It uses a fixed value for demonstration purposes.
    ldr r0, =42  ; Fixed target number (not random)

; Function to prompt the user for a guess
prompt_guess:
    ; This function prompts the user to enter a guess.
    ; It prints a message to the console.
    ; (Implementation omitted for brevity)

; Function to read the user's guess
read_guess:
    ; This function reads the user's guess from the console.
    ; It stores the guess in the 'guess' variable.
    ; (Implementation omitted for brevity)
    bx lr

; Function to compare the guess to the target number
compare_guess:
    ; This function compares the user's guess to the target number.
    ; It sets the condition flags based on the comparison.

    ; This function prints a success message to the console.

; Function to exit the program
exit_program:
    ; This function exits the program.
