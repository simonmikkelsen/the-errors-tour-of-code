/* Safe File Deleter Program
 * Purpose: Delete a file safely and securely.
 * This program is designed to demonstrate the process of deleting a file
 * while ensuring that all resources are properly managed.
 * The program will open a file, perform some operations, and then delete it.
 * It is written in ARM Assembly language for educational purposes.
