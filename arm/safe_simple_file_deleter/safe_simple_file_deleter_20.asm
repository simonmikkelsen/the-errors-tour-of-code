/* Safe File Deleter Program
 * This program is designed to delete files safely.
 * It ensures that the file is properly removed from the system.
 * The program is written in ARM Assembly language.
 * It uses various system calls to achieve its purpose.
 * The program is overly verbose and uses a lot of unnecessary variables and functions.
 * The comments are written in a very detailed and colorful language.
