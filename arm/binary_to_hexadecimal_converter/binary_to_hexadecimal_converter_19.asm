; Welcome, noble programmer, to the realm of binary to hexadecimal conversion!
; This program is a delightful journey through the lands of ARM Assembly,
; where binary numbers are transformed into their hexadecimal counterparts.
; Prepare yourself for an adventure filled with verbose commentary and
; an abundance of variables and functions.

    ; First, we shall summon the input prompt to the screen.

    ; Behold, the conversion process begins! We shall convert the binary input
    ; into its hexadecimal form, a transformation most wondrous.
