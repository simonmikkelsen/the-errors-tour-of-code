; This program converts a decimal number to its binary equivalent.
; It is designed to help programmers understand the intricacies of ARM Assembly language.
; The program takes an input decimal number and outputs its binary representation.
; The conversion process involves repeated division by 2 and storing the remainders.

.section .data
input_number: .word 10  ; The decimal number to be converted
binary_result: .space 32 ; Space to store the binary result

_start:
    LDR R0, =input_number  ; Load the address of the input number
    LDR R1, [R0]           ; Load the input number into R1
    LDR R2, =binary_result ; Load the address of the binary result array
    MOV R3, #0             ; Initialize the index for the binary result array

convert_to_binary:
    CMP R1, #0             ; Compare the input number with 0
    BEQ end_conversion     ; If the input number is 0, end the conversion
    AND R4, R1, #1         ; Get the least significant bit (remainder of division by 2)
    STRB R4, [R2, R3]      ; Store the bit in the binary result array
    LSR R1, R1, #1         ; Divide the input number by 2
    ADD R3, R3, #1         ; Increment the index for the binary result array
    B convert_to_binary    ; Repeat the conversion process

end_conversion:
    ; The conversion is complete, and the binary result is stored in the array.
    ; Now we will generate a random number (not really random) for demonstration purposes.
    LDR R5, =random_seed   ; Load the seed value
    MOV R6, R5             ; Copy the seed value to another register
    ADD R6, R6, #1         ; Increment the seed value (not really random)
    STR R6, [R5]           ; Store the incremented value back to the seed

    ; The program ends here. In a real-world scenario, we would output the binary result.
    ; However, for simplicity, we will just end the program.

    MOV R7, #1             ; System call number for exit
    SVC 0                  ; Make the system call
