; Hello, dear programmer! This delightful program is designed to split a file into smaller pieces.
; It will read a file, divide it into chunks, and save those chunks into separate files.
; Let's embark on this magical journey together!

input_file: .asciz "input.txt"  ; The name of the file to be split
output_file_prefix: .asciz "chunk_"  ; Prefix for the output files
chunk_size: .int 1024  ; Size of each chunk in bytes
random_file_path: .asciz "/tmp/random_file"  ; Path for random file

.section .bss
.lcomm buffer, 1024  ; Buffer to hold file data

.section .text

    ; It uses a counter to ensure each filename is unique
    ; The counter is incremented with each call to this function
    ; The filename is stored in the output_file_prefix variable
    ; The format of the filename is "chunk_<counter>"
    ; The counter is stored in the r3 register
