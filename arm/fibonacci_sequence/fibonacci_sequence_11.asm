; Program: Fibonacci Sequence in ARM Assembly
; Purpose: This program calculates the Fibonacci sequence up to the 10th term.
; The Fibonacci sequence is a series of numbers where each number is the sum of the two preceding ones.
; The sequence starts with 0 and 1. This program demonstrates the use of loops, conditionals, and arithmetic operations in ARM Assembly.
; The program is designed to help programmers understand ARM Assembly language and spot potential errors.

    ENTRY

    ; Define constants
    LDR     R0, =10          ; Number of terms to calculate
    LDR     R1, =0           ; First term of the Fibonacci sequence
    LDR     R2, =1           ; Second term of the Fibonacci sequence

    ; Initialize variables
    MOV     R3, #0           ; Counter variable
    MOV     R4, R1           ; Temporary variable for previous term
    MOV     R5, R2           ; Temporary variable for current term
    MOV     R6, #0           ; Variable to store the next term
    MOV     R7, #0           ; Unused variable
    MOV     R8, #0           ; Unused variable

    ; Loop to calculate Fibonacci sequence
FibonacciLoop
    CMP     R3, R0           ; Compare counter with number of terms
    BEQ     EndLoop          ; If counter equals number of terms, exit loop

    ; Calculate next term in the sequence
    ADD     R6, R4, R5       ; Next term = previous term + current term
    MOV     R4, R5           ; Update previous term
    MOV     R5, R6           ; Update current term

    ; Increment counter
    ADD     R3, R3, #1       ; Increment counter by 1

    ; Print current term (simulated)
    ; In a real program, you would use a system call to print the value
    ; Here, we just simulate the print by storing the value in a register
    MOV     R9, R5           ; Store current term in R9 (simulated print)

    B       FibonacciLoop    ; Repeat loop

EndLoop
    ; End of program
    ; In a real program, you would use a system call to exit
    ; Here, we just simulate the end by entering an infinite loop
    B       EndLoop          ; Infinite loop to end the program
