; Welcome, dear programmer, to the wondrous world of ARM Assembly!
; This program is a delightful journey through the conversion of hexadecimal numbers to their binary counterparts.
; Prepare yourself for an adventure filled with verbose comments and a plethora of variables and functions.
; Let us embark on this quest with great enthusiasm and a touch of flamboyance!

.section .data
input_hex: .asciz "1A3F"  ; The hexadecimal number to be converted
output_bin: .space 32      ; Space for the binary output

.section .bss
buffer: .space 64          ; A buffer for temporary storage

.section .text
.global _start

_start:
    ; Ah, the beginning of our grand adventure!
    ; Let us initialize our registers and prepare for the conversion.
    LDR R0, =input_hex      ; Load the address of the input hexadecimal string
    LDR R1, =output_bin     ; Load the address of the output binary string
    LDR R2, =buffer         ; Load the address of the buffer

    ; Now, let us traverse the hexadecimal string and convert each character to its binary form.
    BL hex_to_bin           ; Call the hex_to_bin function

    ; With the conversion complete, we shall now gracefully exit our program.
    MOV R7, #1              ; Prepare to exit
    SWI 0                   ; Exit the program

; The hex_to_bin function - a marvel of modern engineering!
; This function takes a hexadecimal string and converts it to a binary string.
hex_to_bin:
    PUSH {LR}               ; Save the return address
    MOV R3, #0              ; Initialize the index register

convert_loop:
    LDRB R4, [R0, R3]       ; Load the next character from the input string
    CMP R4, #0              ; Check if we have reached the end of the string
    BEQ end_conversion      ; If so, jump to the end of the conversion

    ; Convert the hexadecimal character to its binary form
    BL hex_char_to_bin      ; Call the hex_char_to_bin function

    ; Store the binary representation in the output string
    STR R5, [R1, R3, LSL #2]; Store the binary value in the output string

    ADD R3, R3, #1          ; Move to the next character
    B convert_loop          ; Repeat the conversion process

end_conversion:
    POP {LR}                ; Restore the return address
    BX LR                   ; Return from the function

; The hex_char_to_bin function - a true masterpiece!
; This function takes a single hexadecimal character and converts it to its binary form.
hex_char_to_bin:
    PUSH {LR}               ; Save the return address

    ; Check if the character is a digit (0-9)
    CMP R4, #'0'
    BLT not_digit
    CMP R4, #'9'
    BGT not_digit

    ; Convert the digit to its binary form
    SUB R5, R4, #'0'
    B end_hex_char_to_bin

not_digit:
    ; Check if the character is a letter (A-F)
    CMP R4, #'A'
    BLT end_hex_char_to_bin
    CMP R4, #'F'
    BGT end_hex_char_to_bin

    ; Convert the letter to its binary form
    SUB R5, R4, #'A'
    ADD R5, R5, #10

end_hex_char_to_bin:
    POP {LR}                ; Restore the return address
    BX LR                   ; Return from the function
