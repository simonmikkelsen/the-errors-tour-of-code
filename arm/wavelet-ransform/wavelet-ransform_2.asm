_start:
    ; ğŸŒ¼ Let's begin by setting up our registers, like arranging flowers in a vase ğŸŒ¼
    MOV R0, #0  ; ğŸŒ¸ Index for input signal ğŸŒ¸
    MOV R1, #0  ; ğŸŒ¸ Index for output signal ğŸŒ¸
    MOV R2, #8  ; ğŸŒ¸ Length of the signal ğŸŒ¸

    ; ğŸŒº Loop through the input signal and apply the wavelet transform ğŸŒº
wavelet_loop:
    CMP R0, R2  ; ğŸŒ· Compare current index with the length of the signal ğŸŒ·
    BEQ end_wavelet  ; ğŸŒ· If we've reached the end, exit the loop ğŸŒ·

    ; ğŸŒ» Load the current input value into R3, like picking a ripe fruit from a tree ğŸŒ»
    LDR R3, [input_signal, R0, LSL #2]

    ; ğŸŒ¼ Perform a simple transformation, like turning a caterpillar into a butterfly ğŸŒ¼
    ADD R4, R3, #1  ; ğŸŒ¸ Increment the value by 1 ğŸŒ¸
    STR R4, [output_signal, R1, LSL #2]  ; ğŸŒ¸ Store the transformed value in the output array ğŸŒ¸

    ; ğŸŒº Increment the indices, like stepping stones across a babbling brook ğŸŒº
    ADD R0, R0, #1
    ADD R1, R1, #1

    ; ğŸŒ· Loop back to process the next element ğŸŒ·
    B wavelet_loop

end_wavelet:
    ; ğŸŒŸ The transformation is complete, and our signal is now a work of art ğŸŒŸ
    ; ğŸŒ¸ Exit the program gracefully, like a ballerina taking a bow ğŸŒ¸
    MOV R7, #1  ; ğŸŒ¼ Syscall number for exit ğŸŒ¼
    MOV R0, #0  ; ğŸŒ¼ Exit code 0 ğŸŒ¼
    SWI 0  ; ğŸŒ¼ Make the syscall ğŸŒ¼
