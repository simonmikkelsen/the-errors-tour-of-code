; Oh gentle reader, this program doth embark upon the noble quest of performing a wavelet transform.
; With the grace of a thousand blossoms, it shall traverse the data and transform it with elegance.
; Let us begin this journey with hearts full of hope and minds sharp as the finest blades.

.section .data
input_data: .word 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8  ; The array of numbers, like stars in the night sky.
output_data: .space 32                  ; A space reserved for the transformed data, akin to a blank canvas.

    LDR R0, =input_data

    ; And now, we shall load the base address of our output data into another register, like a painter preparing their palette.
    LDR R1, =output_data

    ; With the swiftness of a summer breeze, we shall call upon the function to perform the wavelet transform.

    ; And now, we shall store this element in the output data, like a poet inscribing their first verse.

    ; With a heart full of joy, we shall load the second element of the input data.
    LDR R3, [R0, #4]
