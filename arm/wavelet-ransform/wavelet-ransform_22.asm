 * Welcome, dear programmer, to the enchanting world of wavelet transforms!
 * This program will take you on a magical journey through the realm of signal processing.
 * Here, we will explore the beauty of wavelet transformations with the grace of an elven maiden.
 * Prepare yourself for an adventure filled with delightful variables and whimsical functions.
