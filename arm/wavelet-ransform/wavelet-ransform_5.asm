; This delightful program performs a wavelet transform, a mathematical technique
; used to analyze and process signals. It is a beautiful and intricate dance of
; numbers and operations, designed to bring joy and understanding to those who
; study it. The program is written in ARM Assembly, a language as elegant as it
; is powerful. Let us embark on this journey together, dear programmer.
