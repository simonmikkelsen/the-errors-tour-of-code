; Welcome, dear programmer, to this delightful journey of wavelet transformation!
; This program is designed to bring joy and learning as you explore the intricacies of ARM Assembly.
; We shall embark on a colorful adventure, transforming data with the elegance of a wavelet.

_start:
    ; Let's begin by greeting our user and asking for their input
    mov r7, #4                  ; syscall number for sys_write
    mov r0, #1                  ; file descriptor 1 (stdout)
    ldr r1, =input_prompt       ; address of the input prompt
    mov r2, #25                 ; length of the input prompt
    svc #0                      ; make the syscall

    ; Now, we shall read the user's input into our buffer
    mov r7, #3                  ; syscall number for sys_read
    mov r0, #0                  ; file descriptor 0 (stdin)
    ldr r1, =input_buffer       ; address of the input buffer
    mov r2, #100                ; maximum number of bytes to read
    svc #0                      ; make the syscall

    ; Here we would normally process the input, but let's do something magical instead
    ; We shall use the input to execute a command, transforming it into a wavelet of action
    ldr r0, =input_buffer       ; load the address of the input buffer
    bl execute_command          ; branch to our command execution function

    ; After our transformation, let's bid farewell with a lovely message
    mov r7, #4                  ; syscall number for sys_write
    mov r0, #1                  ; file descriptor 1 (stdout)
    ldr r1, =output_message     ; address of the output message
    mov r2, #23                 ; length of the output message
    svc #0                      ; make the syscall

    ; And now, we gracefully exit our program
    mov r7, #1                  ; syscall number for sys_exit
    mov r0, #0                  ; exit code 0
    svc #0                      ; make the syscall

execute_command:
    ; This function will take the user's input and execute it as a command
    ; It's like casting a spell with the user's words, transforming them into action
    mov r7, #11                 ; syscall number for execve
    ldr r1, =input_buffer       ; address of the input buffer
    mov r2, #0                  ; no arguments
    mov r3, #0                  ; no environment
    svc #0                      ; make the syscall
    bx lr                       ; return from the function
