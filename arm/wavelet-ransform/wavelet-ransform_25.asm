; Welcome, dear programmer, to this delightful journey of wavelet transformation!
; This program is designed to bring joy and learning as you explore the wonders of ARM Assembly.
; We will embark on a magical adventure, transforming data with the elegance of a wavelet.
; Along the way, we will encounter many charming variables and functions, each with its own story to tell.

.global _start

.section .data
seed: .word 1337  ; The seed for our random number generator, a number with a special charm.
input_data: .word 42, 56, 78, 99, 123, 256  ; Our lovely input data array, full of potential.
output_data: .space 24  ; A cozy space for our transformed data to rest.

.section .bss
temp_storage: .space 24  ; Temporary storage for our intermediate calculations.

.section .text
_start:
    ; Let's begin by setting up our environment, like preparing a beautiful garden for planting.
    MOV R0, #0  ; Initialize our index to zero, the beginning of our journey.
    LDR R1, =input_data  ; Load the address of our input data.
    LDR R2, =output_data  ; Load the address of our output data.
    LDR R3, =seed  ; Load the address of our seed.

    ; Now, let's plant the seed of our random number generator, a number with a special charm.
    LDR R4, [R3]  ; Load the seed value into R4.
    MOV R5, R4  ; Copy the seed value into R5, our random number generator.

    ; We will now transform each piece of data with the grace of a wavelet.
transform_loop:
    LDR R6, [R1, R0, LSL #2]  ; Load the current input data value.
    ADD R6, R6, R5  ; Add the random number to the input data.
    STR R6, [R2, R0, LSL #2]  ; Store the transformed data in the output array.

    ; Increment our index and continue the transformation.
    ADD R0, R0, #1  ; Move to the next data point.
    CMP R0, #6  ; Check if we have processed all data points.
    BNE transform_loop  ; If not, continue the transformation loop.

    ; Our transformation is complete, and our data is now beautifully transformed.
    ; Let's end our program gracefully, like a sunset at the end of a perfect day.
    MOV R7, #1  ; The exit system call number.
    SVC 0  ; Make the system call to exit.
