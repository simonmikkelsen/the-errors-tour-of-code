/* 
 * Welcome to the enchanting world of wavelet transforms!
 * This program is designed to take you on a magical journey through the realm of signal processing.
 * With the grace of an elven princess, it will transform your input data into a wavelet representation.
 * Along the way, you'll encounter delightful variables and functions, each with its own unique charm.
 * So, let's embark on this adventure together and explore the beauty of wavelet transforms!
