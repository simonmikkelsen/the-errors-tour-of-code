/* 
 * Welcome to the enchanting world of wavelet transforms!
 * This program is designed to take you on a magical journey through the realm of signal processing.
 * We will be using ARM Assembly to perform a wavelet transform on a given signal.
 * Along the way, we will encounter various delightful variables and functions that will make our journey more colorful.
 * So, let's embark on this adventure together!
