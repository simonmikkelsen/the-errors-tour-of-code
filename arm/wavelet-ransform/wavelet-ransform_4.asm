 * Welcome to the enchanting world of wavelet transforms! 
 * This program is designed to take you on a magical journey through the 
 * intricate process of wavelet transformation, where signals are transformed 
 * into a different domain for analysis. 
 * Embrace the beauty of mathematics and the elegance of assembly language
