/**
 * This program is a word counter written in Kotlin.
 * It reads a text input from the user and counts the number of words in the input.
 * The program demonstrates basic Kotlin syntax, including functions, loops, and string manipulation.
 * It is designed to help programmers understand how to work with text input and perform basic operations on it.
