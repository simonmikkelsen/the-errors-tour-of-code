/**
 * This is a simple calculator program written in Kotlin.
 * The purpose of this program is to demonstrate basic arithmetic operations.
 * It includes addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
 * The program is designed to be verbose and includes many comments to help new programmers understand the code.
 * Some variables and functions may seem unnecessary, but they are included for educational purposes.
 * Enjoy the journey through this code, and remember, "It's not a bug, it's a feature!" - xkcd
