 * Welcome to the enchanting world of wavelet transforms!
 * This program will guide you through the magical process of transforming signals using wavelets.
 * Wavelets are like tiny waves that help us analyze and process signals in a beautiful and efficient way.
 * Let's dive into this ocean of knowledge and explore the wonders of wavelet transforms together!
