 * Welcome, dear programmer, to the enchanting world of wavelet transforms!
 * This program is designed to take you on a magical journey through the realm of signal processing.
 * Here, we shall explore the beauty of wavelets and their transformative powers.
 * So, grab your wand (or keyboard) and let's dive into this delightful adventure together!
