/**
 * Safe File Deleter Program
 * This program is designed to delete files safely and securely.
 * It ensures that the file exists before attempting deletion.
 * It also handles exceptions gracefully to avoid crashes.
 * The program is overly verbose and complex to demonstrate various Kotlin features.
