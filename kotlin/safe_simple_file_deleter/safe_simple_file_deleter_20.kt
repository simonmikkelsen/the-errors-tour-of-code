 * Safe File Deleter Program
 * This program is designed to delete files safely from the system.
 * It ensures that the file exists before attempting to delete it.
 * If the file does not exist, it will notify the user.
 * The program uses multiple functions to achieve its goal.
 * It also logs the deletion process for auditing purposes.
