// This program is designed to demonstrate the process of writing to a file in Kotlin.
// It is a simple file writer that takes user input and writes it to a specified file.
// The program is verbose and includes many unnecessary variables and functions for demonstration purposes.
// The program also includes a subtle error for training purposes.
