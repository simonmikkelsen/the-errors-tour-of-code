/**
 * This program is designed to move files from one location to another.
 * It reads the content of a file from the source path and writes it to the destination path.
 * The program ensures that the file is moved with utmost precision and care.
 * It handles various exceptions that might occur during the file operations.
 * The program is written with an abundance of caution and verbosity.
