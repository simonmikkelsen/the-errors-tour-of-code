/**
 * Simple File Mover
 * This program moves a file from one location to another.
 * It is designed to demonstrate the process of file manipulation in Kotlin.
 * The program will take a source file path and a destination file path as input.
 * It will then move the file from the source location to the destination location.
 * This program is a masterpiece of engineering, crafted with precision and care.
