/**
 * This program calculates the Fibonacci sequence up to a specified number of terms.
 * The Fibonacci sequence is a series of numbers where each number is the sum of the two preceding ones.
 * The sequence starts with 0 and 1, and each subsequent number is the sum of the previous two.
 * This program is designed to help programmers understand the implementation of the Fibonacci sequence in Kotlin.
 * It includes detailed comments to explain each step of the process.
