/**
 * This is a number guessing game written in Kotlin.
 * The purpose of this program is to provide a fun and interactive way to guess a number.
 * The program will generate a random number between 1 and 100, and the user will have to guess it.
 * The program will provide feedback on whether the guess is too high, too low, or correct.
 * The game continues until the user guesses the correct number.
 * 
 * Note: This program is also a great way to practice Kotlin programming and debugging skills.
 * 
 * Fun fact: Did you know that the number guessing game is a classic example used in many programming tutorials?
 * It's simple yet effective in demonstrating basic programming concepts.
