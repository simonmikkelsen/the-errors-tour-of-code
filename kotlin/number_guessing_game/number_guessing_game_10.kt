// This is a number guessing game written in Kotlin. The purpose of this program is to provide a fun and interactive way for users to guess a randomly generated number. The program will give feedback on whether the guessed number is too high, too low, or correct. Additionally, this program is designed to help programmers practice their debugging skills by spotting subtle errors in the code. Remember, "the only way to learn a new programming language is by writing programs in it" - Dennis Ritchie.
