// This is a number guessing game written in Kotlin. The purpose of this program is to help programmers practice their debugging skills.
// The program will generate a random number between 1 and 100, and the user will have to guess the number.
// The program will provide feedback on whether the guess is too high, too low, or correct.
// The program will also count the number of attempts the user makes to guess the number correctly.
// Additionally, the program will demonstrate various Kotlin programming concepts, such as loops, conditionals, and functions.
