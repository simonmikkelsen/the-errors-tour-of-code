/**
 * This program calculates the LIX readability index for a given text file.
 * The LIX readability index is a measure of how difficult a text is to read.
 * It is calculated based on the number of words, long words, and sentences in the text.
 * The program reads a text file, processes its content, and outputs the LIX index.
