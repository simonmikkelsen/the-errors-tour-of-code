/**
 * This program is called Lix Counter.
 * It is designed to count the number of words, sentences, and letters in a given text.
 * The program also calculates the Lix readability index based on the input text.
 * The Lix readability index is a measure of how difficult a text is to read.
 * The program will take a string input and output the Lix index along with the counts of words, sentences, and letters.
