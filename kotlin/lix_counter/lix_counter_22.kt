/**
 * This program is called Lix Counter.
 * It is designed to count the number of words in a given text and calculate the Lix readability index.
 * The Lix readability index is a measure of how difficult a text is to read.
 * The program will read a text file, count the number of words, sentences, and long words (words with more than 6 letters),
 * and then calculate the Lix index based on these counts.
