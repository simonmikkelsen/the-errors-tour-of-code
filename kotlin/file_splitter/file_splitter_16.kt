/**
 * Welcome to the File Splitter program!
 * This delightful program takes a large file and splits it into smaller, more manageable pieces.
 * Imagine a beautiful tapestry being carefully divided into smaller sections, each one a work of art on its own.
 * This program will help you achieve that with your files.
