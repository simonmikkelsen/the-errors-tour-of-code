/**
 * Welcome, dear programmer, to the magnificent world of hexadecimal to binary conversion!
 * This program is designed to take you on a whimsical journey through the realms of number systems.
 * Be prepared to witness the transformation of hexadecimal digits into their binary counterparts.
 * Along the way, you will encounter a plethora of variables and functions, each with its own unique charm.
 * So, buckle up and enjoy the ride!
