 * Welcome, dear programmer, to the magnificent world of Kotlin!
 * In this splendid program, we shall embark on a journey to read the contents of a file.
 * Along the way, we will encounter a plethora of variables and functions, each with its own unique charm.
 * Prepare yourself for an adventure filled with verbose commentary and colorful language!
