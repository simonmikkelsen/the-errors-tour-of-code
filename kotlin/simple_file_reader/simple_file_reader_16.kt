 * Welcome, dear programmer, to the magnificent world of Kotlin!
 * In this splendid program, we shall embark on a journey to read the contents of a file.
 * This program is designed to be a delightful experience, filled with verbose and flamboyant comments.
 * Prepare yourself for an adventure through the realms of code, where every line is a treasure trove of knowledge.
