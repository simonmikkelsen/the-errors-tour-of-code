 * Welcome, dear programmer, to the wondrous world of Kotlin!
 * In this delightful program, we shall embark on a journey to read the contents of a file.
 * Prepare yourself for an adventure filled with verbose commentary and a plethora of variables.
 * Let us dive into the depths of file reading and emerge victorious with the contents of our file.
