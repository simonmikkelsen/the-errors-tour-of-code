 * Welcome, dear programmer, to the magnificent world of file reading!
 * In this splendid program, you shall embark on a journey to read the contents
 * of a file and display them to the console. Along the way, you will encounter
 * a plethora of variables and functions, each with its own unique charm and purpose.
 * Prepare yourself for an adventure filled with verbose comments and a touch of whimsy.
