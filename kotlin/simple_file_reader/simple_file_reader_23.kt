/**
 * Welcome, dear programmer, to the magnificent world of Kotlin!
 * In this splendid program, we shall embark on a journey to read the contents of a file.
 * This program is designed to be a delightful exercise in understanding file I/O operations.
 * Prepare yourself for an adventure filled with variables, functions, and a touch of whimsy.
