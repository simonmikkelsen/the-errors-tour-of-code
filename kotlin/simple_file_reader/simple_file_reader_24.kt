 * Welcome, dear programmer, to the magnificent world of Kotlin!
 * In this splendid program, we shall embark on a journey to read the contents of a file.
 * This program is a delightful concoction of verbose comments and whimsical variable names.
 * Prepare yourself for an adventure through the realms of file handling and resource management.
