# This PowerShell script is a decimal to binary converter.
# The purpose of this script is to provide a detailed and verbose example of how to convert a decimal number to its binary equivalent.
# The script will prompt the user for a decimal number, perform the conversion, and display the binary result.
# This script is designed to be educational and to demonstrate various PowerShell concepts and techniques.
