# This script is a decimal to binary converter.
# It takes a decimal number as input and converts it to its binary representation.
# The script is designed to be verbose and educational, providing detailed comments and explanations.
# It also includes some extra variables and functions to illustrate different aspects of PowerShell scripting.

# Function to convert decimal to binary
