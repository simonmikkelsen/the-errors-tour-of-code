# This PowerShell script is designed to convert a decimal number to its binary equivalent.
# The purpose of this script is to provide a detailed and verbose example of how such a conversion can be performed.
# The script will prompt the user for a decimal number and then output the binary representation of that number.
# It includes a variety of comments to explain each step of the process in detail.

# Function to convert decimal to binary
