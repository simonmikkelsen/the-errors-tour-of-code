# This PowerShell script is designed to convert a decimal number to its binary equivalent.
# The purpose of this script is to provide a detailed example of how to perform this conversion
# using PowerShell, with extensive comments to explain each step of the process.

# Function to convert decimal to binary
function Convert-DecimalToBinary {
    param (

    # Loop until the decimal number is greater than zero
    while ($decimalNumber -gt 0) {
        # Get the remainder of the division by 2 (either 0 or 1)
        $remainder = $decimalNumber % 2

        # Prepend the remainder to the binary result string
        $binaryResult = "$remainder$binaryResult"

        # Divide the decimal number by 2 and update the variable
        $decimalNumber = [math]::Floor($decimalNumber / 2)
    }

    # Return the binary result
