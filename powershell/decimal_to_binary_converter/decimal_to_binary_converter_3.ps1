# This PowerShell script is designed to convert a decimal number into its binary equivalent.
# The script will prompt the user to enter a decimal number and then perform the conversion.
# The purpose of this script is to provide a detailed and verbose example of how such a conversion can be implemented in PowerShell.
# The script includes numerous comments to explain each step of the process in great detail.

# Function to convert decimal to binary
function Convert-DecimalToBinary {
    param (
        [int]$decimalNumber
    )

    # Initialize an empty string to store the binary result
    $binaryResult = ""

    # Loop until the decimal number is greater than 0
    while ($decimalNumber -gt 0) {
        # Get the remainder of the division by 2 (this will be 0 or 1)
        $remainder = $decimalNumber % 2

        # Prepend the remainder to the binary result string
        $binaryResult = "$remainder$binaryResult"

        # Divide the decimal number by 2 and update the variable
        $decimalNumber = [math]::Floor($decimalNumber / 2)
    }

    # Return the binary result
    return $binaryResult

    # Prompt the user to enter a decimal number

    # Convert the user input to an integer
    $decimalNumber = [int]$userInput

    # Return the decimal number

# Main script execution starts here

# Call the function to get user input

# Display the binary result to the user
