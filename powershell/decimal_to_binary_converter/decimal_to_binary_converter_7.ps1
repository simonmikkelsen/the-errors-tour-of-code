# This PowerShell script is designed to convert a decimal number to its binary equivalent.
# The purpose of this script is to help programmers understand the process of conversion
# from decimal to binary, and to practice their debugging skills by identifying and fixing errors.
# The script takes a decimal number as input and outputs the binary representation of that number.
# It also includes verbose comments to explain each step of the process in detail.

# Function to convert decimal to binary
function Convert-DecimalToBinary {
    param (
        [int]$decimalNumber
    )

    # Initialize an empty string to store the binary result
    $binaryResult = ""

    # Loop until the decimal number is greater than zero
    while ($decimalNumber -gt 0) {
        # Get the remainder of the division by 2 (either 0 or 1)
        $remainder = $decimalNumber % 2

        # Prepend the remainder to the binary result string
        $binaryResult = "$remainder$binaryResult"

        # Divide the decimal number by 2 and update the variable
        $decimalNumber = [math]::Floor($decimalNumber / 2)
    }

    # Return the binary result
    return $binaryResult
}

# Function to get user input
function Get-UserInput {
    # Prompt the user to enter a decimal number
    Write-Host "Please enter a decimal number:"

    # Read the user input and convert it to an integer
    $userInput = [int](Read-Host)

    # Return the user input
    return $userInput
}

# Main script execution starts here
# Get the decimal number from the user
$decimalNumber = Get-UserInput

# Convert the decimal number to binary
$binaryResult = Convert-DecimalToBinary -decimalNumber $decimalNumber

# Display the binary result to the user
