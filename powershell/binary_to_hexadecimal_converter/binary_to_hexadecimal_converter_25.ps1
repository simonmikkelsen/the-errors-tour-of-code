Welcome, dear programmer, to the magnificent world of binary to hexadecimal conversion! This script is designed to take you on an enchanting journey through the realms of binary numbers and their hexadecimal counterparts. Prepare yourself for an odyssey filled with verbose commentary and whimsical variable names, as we delve into the depths of PowerShell scripting. May your mind be as clear as the azure sky, and your code as flawless as a diamond.

The purpose of this script is to convert a binary number, provided by the user, into its hexadecimal equivalent. Along the way, we shall encounter various functions and variables, each with their own unique charm and purpose. So, without further ado, let us embark on this grand adventure!
