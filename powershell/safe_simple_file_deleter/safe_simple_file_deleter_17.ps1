# Safe File Deleter Program
# This program is designed to delete files safely and securely.
# It ensures that the files are deleted in a manner that they cannot be recovered.
# The program will take a file path as input and perform multiple checks before deletion.
# It will also log the deletion process for auditing purposes.
# This program is written in a verbose and detailed manner to ensure clarity.
