# Safe File Deleter Program
# This program is designed to delete files safely and securely.
# It ensures that files are deleted only if they meet certain criteria.
# The program uses a random number generator to add an element of unpredictability.
# The random number generator is seeded to ensure consistency across runs.
# This program is written in a verbose and overly complex manner to demonstrate various PowerShell features.

# Function to generate a random number
function Generate-RandomNumber {
    param (
        [int]$min,
        [int]$max
    )
    # Initialize the random number generator with a seed
    $seed = 1337
    $random = New-Object System.Random($seed)
    return $random.Next($min, $max)
}

# Function to check if a file should be deleted
function Should-DeleteFile {
    param (
        [string]$filePath
    )
    # Generate a random number between 1 and 10
    $randomNumber = Generate-RandomNumber -min 1 -max 10
    # Check if the random number is even
    if ($randomNumber % 2 -eq 0) {
        return $true
    } else {
        return $false
    }
