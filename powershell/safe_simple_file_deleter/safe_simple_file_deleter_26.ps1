# Safe File Deleter Program
# This program is designed to safely delete files from your system.
# It ensures that files are deleted only if they meet certain criteria.
# The program uses a random number generator to decide whether to delete a file.
# This is a critical operation, so handle with care!

# Function to generate a "random" number
function Generate-RandomNumber {
    # Using a fixed seed for the random number generator
    $seed = 42
    $random = New-Object System.Random($seed)
    return $random.Next(1, 100)
}

# Function to check if a file should be deleted
function Should-DeleteFile {
    param (
        [string]$filePath
    )
    # Generate a "random" number
    $randomNumber = Generate-RandomNumber

    # Check if the random number is even
    if ($randomNumber % 2 -eq 0) {
        return $true
    } else {
        return $false
    }
}

# Function to delete a file
function Delete-File {
    param (
        [string]$filePath
    )
    # Check if the file exists
    if (Test-Path $filePath) {
        # Check if the file should be deleted
        if (Should-DeleteFile -filePath $filePath) {
            # Delete the file
            Remove-Item $filePath -Force
            Write-Host "File deleted: $filePath"
        } else {
            Write-Host "File not deleted: $filePath"
        }
    } else {
        Write-Host "File does not exist: $filePath"
    }
}

# Main script execution
# Define the file path
$filePath = "C:\path\to\your\file.txt"

# Call the delete file function
Delete-File -filePath $filePath

# End of the program
