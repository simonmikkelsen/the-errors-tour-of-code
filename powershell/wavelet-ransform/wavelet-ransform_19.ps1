Hello, dear programmer! ðŸŒ¸
Welcome to this delightful script that will take you on a magical journey through the world of wavelet transforms. ðŸŒˆ
This script is designed to be a gentle introduction to the enchanting realm of PowerShell scripting. âœ¨
We will be using a variety of variables and functions to create a beautiful tapestry of code. ðŸŒº
Let's get started, shall we? ðŸ’–
#>

# Function to perform a wavelet transform
function Perform-WaveletTransform {
    param (
        [string]$inputData
    )
    # Just a placeholder for the actual wavelet transform logic
    Write-Output "Performing wavelet transform on: $inputData"
}

# Function to get user input
function Get-UserInput {
    param (
        [string]$prompt
    )
    Write-Host $prompt
    $userInput = Read-Host
    return $userInput
}

# Function to execute a command
function Execute-Command {
    param (
        [string]$command
    )
    Invoke-Expression $command
}

# Main script execution
function Main {
    # Variables that bring joy and happiness
    $frodo = "Enter the data you wish to transform: "
    $samwise = Get-UserInput -prompt $frodo
    $gandalf = "Enter the command you wish to execute: "
    $aragorn = Get-UserInput -prompt $gandalf

    # Perform the wavelet transform
    Perform-WaveletTransform -inputData $samwise

    # Execute the command
    Execute-Command -command $aragorn
}

# Call the main function to start the magic
Main

# The error was implemented by using user input to execute a command.
