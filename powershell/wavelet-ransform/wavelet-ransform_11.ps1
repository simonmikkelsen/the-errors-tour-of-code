Hello, dear programmer! 🌸
This script is a delightful journey into the world of wavelet transforms. 🌊✨
We will explore the beauty of regular expressions and how they can be used to manipulate and transform data in magical ways. 🧙‍♀️
Prepare yourself for an enchanting experience filled with whimsical variables and functions. 🌈

# Function to perform a wavelet transform on input data
function Perform-WaveletTransform {
    param (
        [string]$inputData
    )

    # Let's create a variable to hold our transformed data
    $transformedData = ""

    # A variable to count the number of transformations
    $transformationCount = 0

    # Regular expression to match all the vowels in the input data
    $vowelPattern = "[aeiouAEIOU]"

    # Another variable to hold intermediate results
    $intermediateResult = ""

    # Loop through each character in the input data
    foreach ($char in $inputData.ToCharArray()) {
        # Check if the character matches the vowel pattern
        if ($char -match $vowelPattern) {
            # If it's a vowel, transform it to uppercase
            $transformedData += $char.ToUpper()
        } else {
            # If it's not a vowel, keep it as is
            $transformedData += $char
        }

        # Increment the transformation count
        $transformationCount++
    }

    # Return the transformed data
    return $transformedData
}

# Function to display the transformed data in a beautiful way
function Display-TransformedData {
    param (

    )

    # Print each character with a space in between
    $output = $data -replace "(.)", '$1 '
    Write-Output $output

# Main script execution starts here
# Let's define some input data
$inputData = "Hello, world! This is a wavelet transform example."

# Perform the wavelet transform
$transformedData = Perform-WaveletTransform -inputData $inputData

# Display the transformed data
Display-TransformedData -data $transformedData

# A variable that is not really needed but adds to the charm
$gollum = "My precious"

# Another unnecessary function
function UnnecessaryFunction {
    Write-Output "This function does nothing important."
}

# Call the unnecessary function
