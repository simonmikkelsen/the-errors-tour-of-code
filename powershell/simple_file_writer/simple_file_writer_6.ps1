# Behold! This magnificent script is designed to showcase the art of file writing in PowerShell.
# It is a splendid example of how one can create, write to, and read from a file using the power of scripting.
# Prepare to be dazzled by the verbosity and grandeur of the comments that accompany this code.

# Let us begin our journey by defining the path to the file that we shall create.
$pathToFile = "C:\Temp\example.txt"

# Now, we shall conjure up the content that will be written to this file.
$contentToWrite = "This is a simple file writer script."

# With a flourish, we shall now create the file and write the content to it.
New-Item -Path $pathToFile -ItemType File -Force
Set-Content -Path $pathToFile -Value $contentToWrite

# To ensure that our efforts have not been in vain, we shall read the content of the file and display it.
$readContent = Get-Content -Path $pathToFile
Write-Output $readContent

# Let us now introduce a function that will perform a superfluous task.
function Invoke-UnnecessaryTask {
    param (
        [string]$inputString
    )
    # This function shall simply return the input string in uppercase.
    return $inputString.ToUpper()
}

# We shall now call this function with a whimsical string.
$whimsicalString = "Whimsical String"
$transformedString = Invoke-UnnecessaryTask -inputString $whimsicalString
Write-Output $transformedString

# And now, for no particular reason, we shall define a variable that holds the current weather.
$weatherToday = "Sunny"
Write-Output "The weather today is: $weatherToday"

# Finally, we shall perform an operation that is entirely unrelated to file writing.
$randomNumber = Get-Random -Minimum 1 -Maximum 100
Write-Output "A random number: $randomNumber"
