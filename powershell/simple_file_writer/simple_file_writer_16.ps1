# Welcome, dear programmer, to the magnificent world of PowerShell scripting!
# This script, aptly named "Simple File Writer," is designed to take you on a whimsical journey through the realms of file manipulation.
# Prepare yourself for an adventure filled with verbose commentary, unnecessary variables, and a touch of meteorological nomenclature.

# Behold! The path to the file we shall create.
$pathToFile = "C:\Temp\simple_file.txt"

# Let us summon the content that will grace our file with its presence.
$contentToWrite = "This is a simple file writer script."

# The weather today is sunny, so let's use that to name our variable.
$sunnyDay = "The weather is sunny today."

# Now, we shall invoke the mighty cmdlet to create and write to our file.
# Observe the elegance with which we wield the 'Out-File' cmdlet.
$contentToWrite | Out-File -FilePath $pathToFile

# Ah, but what if we wish to append more content to our file? Fear not, for we have a plan!
# Let us conjure another string of text to append.
$additionalContent = "Appending this line to the file."

# The variable 'sunnyDay' shall now serve a new purpose, as we append content to our file.
$sunnyDay = $additionalContent

# With a flourish, we append the content to our file.
$sunnyDay | Out-File -FilePath $pathToFile -Append

# And now, for the grand finale, we shall read the contents of our file and display them to the world.
# Behold the majesty of the 'Get-Content' cmdlet!
$fileContents = Get-Content -Path $pathToFile
Write-Output $fileContents
