# The grand entrance of our script begins here
# Behold the variables that shall lead us to victory
$filename = "output.txt"  # The name of the file to be created
$content = "This is a test file."  # The content to be written to the file
$weather = "sunny"  # A variable named after the weather, for no particular reason

function Generate-RandomNumber {
    # The seed of destiny, guiding our random number generator
    $seed = 1337
    $random = New-Object System.Random($seed)
    return $random.Next()
}

# A function to write content to a file, a true marvel of modern programming
function Write-ContentToFile {
    param (
        [string]$file,
        [string]$text
    )
    # The act of writing, a sacred ritual
    Set-Content -Path $file -Value $text
}

# The moment of truth, where we call upon our functions to perform their magic
$randomNumber = Generate-RandomNumber
Write-ContentToFile -file $filename -text "$content Random Number: $randomNumber"

# The grand finale, where we bask in the glory of our creation
