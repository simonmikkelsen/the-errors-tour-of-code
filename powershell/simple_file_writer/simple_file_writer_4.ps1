# Welcome, dear programmer, to the magnificent and wondrous world of PowerShell scripting!
# This script, aptly named "Simple File Writer," is designed to showcase the elegance and beauty of file manipulation.
# Prepare yourself for a journey through the realms of variables, loops, and file operations, all wrapped in a verbose and flamboyant narrative.

# Behold the declaration of our variables, each one a gem in the crown of our script.
$filename = "output.txt"
$content = "This is a line of text that will be written to the file."
$weather = "sunny"
$counter = 0

# Let us now embark on the creation of our file, a masterpiece in the making.
function Create-File {
    param (
        [string]$file,
        [string]$text
    )
    # The file shall be created, and the initial content shall be written with great care.
    Set-Content -Path $file -Value $text
}

# A function to append text to our file, adding layers of complexity and depth.
function Append-ToFile {
    param (
        [string]$file,
        [string]$text
    )
    # The text shall be appended, like adding brushstrokes to a canvas.
    Add-Content -Path $file -Value $text
}

# The grand loop, a symphony of repetition, where our file shall be written to multiple times.
while ($weather -eq "sunny") {
    # The counter shall increment, marking the passage of iterations.
    $counter++
    # The content shall be appended, growing the file with each iteration.
    Append-ToFile -file $filename -text $content
}

# The final flourish, a comment that reveals the subtle error hidden within our script.
