# This program is a simple file copier. It copies files from one location to another.
# It is designed to be overly verbose and complex to demonstrate the intricacies of PowerShell scripting.
# The program will take a source file path and a destination file path as input and copy the file.
# It will also include unnecessary variables and functions to add complexity.

# Function to check if a file exists
