# Simple File Copier Program
# This program is designed to copy files from one location to another.
# It takes user input for the source and destination paths.
# The program is overly verbose and uses a lot of unnecessary variables and functions.
# Let's get started with this overly complex and colorful journey.

    # Function to get the source path from the user
    param (
        [string]$prompt = "Enter the source file path: "

    param (
        [string]$prompt = "Enter the destination file path: "
