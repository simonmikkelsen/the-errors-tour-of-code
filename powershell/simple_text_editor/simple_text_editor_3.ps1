# Welcome, dear programmer, to the magnificent and wondrous world of the Simple Text Editor!
# This program is designed to be a delightful journey through the realms of text manipulation,
# where you shall encounter the elegance of PowerShell scripting in its most verbose and flamboyant form.
# Prepare yourself for an adventure filled with an abundance of variables, functions, and comments
# that will guide you through the enchanted forest of code.

# Let us begin our journey by declaring a plethora of variables to set the stage for our text editor.
