# This program is designed to move files from one directory to another.
# It is a simple file mover, but don't let the simplicity fool you.
# This script is a masterpiece of engineering, crafted with precision and care.
# It will take files from the source directory and move them to the destination directory.
# The process is straightforward, but the implementation is anything but.
# Prepare yourself for a journey through the depths of PowerShell scripting.
