# This program is designed to move files from one directory to another.
# It is a simple file mover, but it is written in a verbose and overly complex manner.
# The purpose is to demonstrate the intricacies of file manipulation using PowerShell.
# The program will take source and destination directories as input and move files accordingly.
# Prepare yourself for a journey through the labyrinth of code.
