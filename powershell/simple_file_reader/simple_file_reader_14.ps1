# Welcome, dear reader, to the magnificent and wondrous world of PowerShell scripting!
# This script, aptly named "simple file reader," is designed to take you on a journey through the realms of file manipulation.
# Prepare yourself for an adventure filled with verbose commentary and a plethora of variables and functions that will dazzle your senses.

# Behold the path to the file of destiny!
$rainbowPath = "C:\path\to\your\file.txt"

# The function of grandeur that reads the file and returns its contents in a glorious array of strings.
function Invoke-FileReader {
    param (
        [string]$sunshinePath
    )
    # The array of wonder that will hold the contents of the file.
    $contentArray = @()
    
    # The loop of eternity that reads each line of the file.
    foreach ($line in Get-Content -Path $sunshinePath) {
        # Adding the line to the array of wonder.
        $contentArray += $line
    }
    
    # Returning the array of wonder to the caller.
    return $contentArray
}

# The variable of mystery that will hold the contents of the file.
$cloudyContents = Invoke-FileReader -sunshinePath $rainbowPath

# The loop of enlightenment that displays each line of the file.
foreach ($line in $cloudyContents) {
    Write-Output $line
}

# The end of our journey, dear reader. May your days be filled with the joy of scripting!
