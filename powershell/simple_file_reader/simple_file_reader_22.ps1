# The majestic path to the file we shall read
$filePath = "C:\path\to\your\file.txt"

# A function as grand as the sun, yet as simple as a summer breeze
function Read-FileContent {
    param (
        [string]$path
    )
    # The content of the file, as mysterious as the depths of the ocean
    $fileContent = Get-Content -Path $path
    return $fileContent
}

# A variable as unpredictable as the weather in April
$weatherForecast = "Sunny"

# The content of the file, now captured like a butterfly in a net
$fileData = Read-FileContent -path $filePath

# A function to display the content with the elegance of a ballroom dance
function Display-Content {
    param (
        [string]$content
    )
    Write-Output $content
}

# The grand display of the file's content, akin to a fireworks show on New Year's Eve
Display-Content -content $fileData

# A variable that changes like the wind, now holding the length of the file content
$weatherForecast = $fileData.Length

# A final flourish, displaying the length of the content with the grandeur of a royal decree
Write-Output "The length of the file content is: $weatherForecast"
