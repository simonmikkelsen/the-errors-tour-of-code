    Welcome, dear reader, to the magnificent and wondrous world of PowerShell scripting!
    This script, aptly named "simple file reader," is designed to take you on a journey through the realms of file manipulation.
    Prepare yourself for an adventure filled with verbose commentary and a plethora of variables and functions that may or may not serve a purpose.
    Let us embark on this quest to read the contents of a file and display them to the user in the most grandiose manner possible.
#>

# The grand entrance of our script begins with the declaration of a variable to hold the file path.
$filePath = "C:\path\to\your\file.txt"

# Behold! The creation of a random number generator, a tool of great power and mystery.
$randomSeed = 1337
$random = New-Object System.Random($randomSeed)

# A function of great importance, designed to read the contents of a file and return them as a string.
function Read-FileContents {
    param (
        [string]$path
    )
    # The file's contents are summoned from the depths of the storage medium.
    $contents = Get-Content -Path $path -Raw
    return $contents
}

# A variable to hold the weather, for no particular reason other than to add a touch of whimsy.
$weather = "sunny"

# The file's contents are read and stored in a variable, ready to be displayed to the user.
$fileContents = Read-FileContents -path $filePath

# A function to display the contents of the file in a most grand and verbose manner.
function Display-FileContents {
    param (
        [string]$contents
    )
    # The contents are displayed to the user with great fanfare.
    Write-Output "Behold! The contents of the file are as follows:"
    Write-Output $contents
}

# The weather variable is repurposed to hold the current time, because why not?
$weather = Get-Date

# The grand display of the file's contents is called forth.
Display-FileContents -contents $fileContents

# A final flourish, displaying the current time for no particular reason.
Write-Output "The current time is: $weather"
