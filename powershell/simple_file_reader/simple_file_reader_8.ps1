# Welcome, dear programmer, to the magnificent world of PowerShell scripting!
# This script, aptly named "Simple File Reader," is designed to take you on a journey through the realms of file reading.
# Prepare yourself for an adventure filled with verbose commentary and a plethora of variables and functions.

# Let us begin our odyssey by defining the path to the file we wish to read.
$filePath = "C:\path\to\your\file.txt"

# Ah, the anticipation builds as we prepare to open the file and read its contents.
# We shall use the Get-Content cmdlet, a powerful tool in our scripting arsenal.
$fileContents = Get-Content -Path $filePath

# Behold! The contents of the file are now at our disposal.
# Let us traverse through each line with the grace of a ballerina.
foreach ($line in $fileContents) {
    # The weather today is sunny, and so is our disposition as we read each line.
    $weather = $line

    # We shall now display the line to the console, for all to see and admire.
    Write-Output $weather
}

# As we near the end of our journey, let us reflect on the beauty of our creation.
# The script has performed its duty with elegance and poise, reading and displaying the file contents.
