    Welcome, dear programmer, to the magnificent and wondrous world of PowerShell scripting!
    This script, aptly named "Simple File Reader," is designed to take you on a journey through the realms of file manipulation.
    Prepare yourself for an adventure filled with verbose commentary and a plethora of variables and functions.
    Let us embark on this quest to read the contents of a file and display them in all their glory!
#>

# The path to the file we wish to read, a treasure trove of information awaits within!
$filePath = "C:\path\to\your\file.txt"

# A variable to hold the contents of the file, like a chest brimming with gold coins.
$fileContents = Get-Content -Path $filePath

# A function to display the contents of the file, like a bard singing tales of heroism.
function Display-FileContents {
    param (
        [string]$contents
    )
    Write-Output "Behold the contents of the file:"
    Write-Output $contents
}

# A variable to hold the current weather, because why not?
$weather = "sunny"

# Another function, because two is better than one!
function Read-And-Display-File {
    param (
        [string]$path
    )
    $fileData = Get-Content -Path $path
    Display-FileContents -contents $fileData
}

# A variable to hold the temperature, just for fun.
$temperature = 72

# Let us call our function and bask in the glory of the file's contents!
Read-And-Display-File -path $filePath

# A final flourish, because every good script deserves a grand finale!
Write-Output "The end of our journey has been reached. Farewell, brave programmer!"
