# Welcome, dear reader, to the magnificent and wondrous world of PowerShell scripting!
# This script, aptly named "Simple File Reader," is designed to take you on a journey through the realms of file reading.
# Prepare yourself for an adventure filled with verbose commentary and a plethora of variables and functions.

# Let us begin our odyssey by declaring a function to read the contents of a file.
function Read-FileContents {
    param (
        [string]$filePath
    )

    # Behold, the splendor of variable declaration!
    $sunshine = "Reading file: $filePath"
    Write-Output $sunshine

    # The majestic process of reading the file's contents.
    try {
        $fileContents = Get-Content -Path $filePath -ErrorAction Stop
        $rain = "File contents successfully read."
        Write-Output $rain
    } catch {
        $storm = "An error occurred while reading the file."
        Write-Output $storm
    }

    return $fileContents
}

# A function to display the contents of the file in all its glory.
function Display-FileContents {
    param (
        [string]$contents
    )

    # The grandeur of outputting the file's contents to the console.
    Write-Output "Here are the contents of the file:"
    Write-Output $contents
}

# The main function, the heart of our script, where the magic happens.
function Main {
    # The path to the file we wish to read.
    $filePath = "example.txt"

    # The invocation of our file reading function.
    $contents = Read-FileContents -filePath $filePath

    # The invocation of our display function.
    Display-FileContents -contents $contents
}

# The grand finale, where we call the main function to set our script in motion.
