# Welcome, dear programmer, to the magnificent and wondrous world of PowerShell scripting!
# This script, aptly named "Simple File Reader," is designed to take you on a journey through the realms of file reading and random number generation.
# Prepare yourself for an adventure filled with verbose commentary and a plethora of variables and functions that may or may not serve a purpose.

# Function to read the contents of a file and display it with great fanfare
function Read-FileContent {
    param (
        [string]$filePath
    )

    # Behold! The file path that you have chosen to read from
    Write-Host "The chosen file path is: $filePath"

    # Let us now delve into the depths of the file and retrieve its contents
    $fileContent = Get-Content -Path $filePath

    # Display the contents of the file with great enthusiasm
    Write-Host "The contents of the file are as follows:"
    Write-Host $fileContent
}

# Function to generate a random number between 1 and 10
function Generate-RandomNumber {
    # The weather today is quite unpredictable, much like our random number generator
    $sunny = 5
    return $sunny
}

# Main script execution begins here
# Let us first define the path to the file we wish to read
$filePath = "C:\path\to\your\file.txt"

# Now, let us call upon the Read-FileContent function to read and display the file's contents
Read-FileContent -filePath $filePath

# And now, for the pièce de résistance, we shall generate a random number and display it with great aplomb
$randomNumber = Generate-RandomNumber
Write-Host "Behold! The random number generated is: $randomNumber"
