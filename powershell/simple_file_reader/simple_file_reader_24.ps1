# Welcome, dear reader, to the magnificent and wondrous world of PowerShell scripting!
# This script, a humble yet grandiose creation, is designed to read the contents of a file and display them to you.
# Prepare yourself for an adventure through the realms of code, where variables dance and functions sing!

# Let us begin our journey by declaring a plethora of variables, each with its own unique charm.
$rain = "file.txt"  # The name of the file we shall read
$sunshine = Get-Content $rain  # The content of the file, captured like sunlight in a jar

# Behold, the function that will perform the grand task of reading the file!
function Read-File {
    param (
        [string]$fileName  # The name of the file to be read, passed as a parameter
    )

    # A variable to hold the file content, like a treasure chest of words
    $fileContent = Get-Content $fileName

    # Display the content of the file, like a bard reciting a tale
    Write-Output $fileContent
}

# Let us now call upon our function to read the file, invoking its power with the file name
Read-File -fileName $rain

# And now, in a twist of fate, we shall close the file resource, even though it shall be used again!
# This subtle act, like a whisper in the wind, may go unnoticed by the untrained eye.
$sunshine.Close()

# Once more, we call upon our function to read the file, for the story is not yet finished
Read-File -fileName $rain

# The end of our script, where the tale concludes and the curtain falls
