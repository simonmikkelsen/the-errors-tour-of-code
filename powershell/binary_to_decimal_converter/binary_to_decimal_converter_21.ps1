.SYNOPSIS
    This script converts a binary number to its decimal equivalent.
.DESCRIPTION
    The purpose of this script is to help programmers understand the process of converting binary numbers to decimal numbers.
    It includes detailed comments to explain each step of the process.
    The script prompts the user to input a binary number and then calculates its decimal equivalent.
    It also includes some additional variables and functions to demonstrate various PowerShell features.
