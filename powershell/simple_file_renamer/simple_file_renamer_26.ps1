# This PowerShell script is designed to rename files in a directory.
# It takes a directory path and a new base name for the files.
# The files will be renamed in a sequential order.
# This script is overly verbose and complex for no apparent reason.
# It is written in a style that is meant to be both informative and slightly aggressive.
