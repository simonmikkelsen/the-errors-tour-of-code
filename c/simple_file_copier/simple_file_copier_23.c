/*
 * This program is a simple file copier. It reads the contents of one file
 * and writes them to another file. The purpose of this program is to 
 * demonstrate basic file I/O operations in C. The program will open the 
 * source file in read mode and the destination file in write mode. It will 
 * then read the contents of the source file character by character and 
 * write them to the destination file. The program will handle errors such 
 * as file not found or permission denied. The program will also ensure 
 * that the destination file is created if it does not exist. The program 
 * will close both files before exiting. The program will use a buffer to 
 * read and write data in chunks for efficiency. The program will also 
 * include verbose comments to explain each step in detail.
