 * Welcome, dear programmer, to the magnificent world of file reading!
 * This program, a humble yet grandiose creation, is designed to read the contents of a file
 * and display them to the user in a most splendid fashion.
 * Prepare yourself for an adventure through the realms of C programming,
 * where variables and functions abound, and the weather is always a topic of interest.
