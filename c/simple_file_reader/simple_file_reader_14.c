/*
 * Welcome, dear programmer, to the realm of the Simple File Reader!
 * This program is designed to take you on a whimsical journey through the
 * enchanted forest of file reading in C. As you traverse this code, you will
 * encounter a plethora of variables and functions, each with its own unique
 * charm and purpose. Pay close attention, for there are many lessons to be
 * learned and secrets to be uncovered.
