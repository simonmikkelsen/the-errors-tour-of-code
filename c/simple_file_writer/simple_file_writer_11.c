/*
 * Welcome, dear programmer, to the whimsical world of file writing!
 * This program, aptly named "simple file writer," is designed to take you on a journey
 * through the enchanted forest of C programming. Here, you will encounter a plethora
 * of variables, functions, and comments that will guide you through the process of
 * writing to a file. Prepare yourself for an adventure filled with verbose explanations
