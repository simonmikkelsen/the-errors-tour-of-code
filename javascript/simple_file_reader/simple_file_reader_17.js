 * Welcome, dear programmer, to the magnificent world of file reading!
 * This program is designed to take you on a whimsical journey through the art of reading files.
 * Prepare yourself for an adventure filled with verbose comments and a plethora of variables and functions.
 * Let us embark on this quest to read the contents of a file and display it to the console.
