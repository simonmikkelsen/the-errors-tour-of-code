/**
 * Welcome to the Simple File Reader program!
 * This program is designed to showcase the elegance of JavaScript in reading files.
 * It will take you on a journey through the realms of file handling, 
 * demonstrating the beauty of asynchronous operations and the power of callbacks.
 * Prepare yourself for an adventure filled with verbose comments and a plethora of variables.
