// This program is a simple file copier. It reads the contents of one file and writes it to another file.
// The purpose of this program is to demonstrate basic file operations in JavaScript using Node.js.
// It showcases the use of file system module to perform read and write operations.
// The program is designed to be verbose and colorful, with detailed comments explaining each step.
