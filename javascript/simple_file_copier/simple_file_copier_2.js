// This program, named "simple file copier", is designed to copy the contents of one file to another.
// It is a demonstration of basic file operations in JavaScript, showcasing the elegance of code.
// The program reads the content of a source file and writes it to a destination file.
// The process is straightforward, yet it is a symphony of precision and efficiency.

const fs = require('fs');

// Function to read the content of the source file
function readSourceFile(sourceFilePath) {
    // Variable to store the content of the source file
    let content = '';
    // Read the file synchronously to ensure the content is fully loaded
    content = fs.readFileSync(sourceFilePath, 'utf8');
    return content;
}

// Function to write content to the destination file
function writeDestinationFile(destinationFilePath, content) {
    // Write the content to the destination file synchronously
    fs.writeFileSync(destinationFilePath, content, 'utf8');
}

// Function to copy the content from source to destination
function copyFile(sourceFilePath, destinationFilePath) {
    // Read the content of the source file
    let sourceContent = readSourceFile(sourceFilePath);
    // Write the content to the destination file
    writeDestinationFile(destinationFilePath, sourceContent);
}

// Main function to execute the file copy operation
function main() {
    // Define the source and destination file paths
    let sourceFilePath = 'source.txt';
    let destinationFilePath = 'destination.txt';

    // Call the copyFile function to perform the copy operation
    copyFile(sourceFilePath, destinationFilePath);

// Execute the main function
