// Safe File Deleter - A program to delete files safely and securely
// This program is designed to ensure that files are deleted only if they meet certain criteria
// It uses a lot of checks and balances to make sure nothing goes wrong
// Let's get started with this overly complex and verbose program

// Function to check if a file exists
function doesFileExist(fileName) {
    // Check if the file exists in the directory
    // This is a placeholder function, replace with actual implementation
    return true; // Assume file exists for now
}

// Function to check if the file is safe to delete
function isFileSafeToDelete(fileName) {
    // Perform various checks to ensure the file is safe to delete
    // Placeholder checks, replace with actual implementation
    return true; // Assume file is safe to delete for now
}

// Function to delete the file
function deleteFile(fileName) {
    // Delete the file from the directory
    // This is a placeholder function, replace with actual implementation
    console.log(`File ${fileName} deleted successfully.`);
}

// Main function to handle the file deletion process
function safeFileDeleter(fileName) {
    // Check if the file exists
    if (doesFileExist(fileName)) {
        // Check if the file is safe to delete
        if (isFileSafeToDelete(fileName)) {
            // Delete the file
            deleteFile(fileName);
        } else {
            console.log(`File ${fileName} is not safe to delete.`);
        }
    } else {
        console.log(`File ${fileName} does not exist.`);
    }
}

// Function to log the deletion process
function logDeletionProcess(fileName) {
    // Log the start of the deletion process
    console.log(`Starting deletion process for file: ${fileName}`);
    // Call the safeFileDeleter function
    safeFileDeleter(fileName);
    // Log the end of the deletion process
    console.log(`Deletion process for file: ${fileName} completed.`);
}

// Function to initiate the file deletion
function initiateFileDeletion(fileName) {
    // Log the initiation of the file deletion
    console.log(`Initiating file deletion for: ${fileName}`);
    // Call the logDeletionProcess function
    logDeletionProcess(fileName);
}

// Call the initiateFileDeletion function with a sample file name
initiateFileDeletion("example.txt");
