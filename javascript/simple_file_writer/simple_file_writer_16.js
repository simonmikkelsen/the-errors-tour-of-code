/**
 * Welcome to the Simple File Writer program!
 * This program is designed to showcase the art of writing to files using JavaScript.
 * It will take user input and write it to a file, demonstrating the elegance of file handling.
 * Prepare to be dazzled by the verbosity and flamboyance of the comments that guide you through this journey.
