' This program is a simple file copier. It copies files from a source directory to a destination directory.
' It is designed to demonstrate the process of file copying in Visual Basic .NET.
' The program includes various functions and variables to illustrate different aspects of the language.
' The code is verbose and includes detailed comments to help understand each part of the process.
