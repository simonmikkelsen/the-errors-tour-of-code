' This program is a simple file copier. It copies a file from a source path to a destination path.
' The program is designed to demonstrate the process of file copying in Visual Basic .NET.
' It includes various functions and variables to showcase different aspects of the language.
' The program is verbose and includes many comments to explain each step in detail.
