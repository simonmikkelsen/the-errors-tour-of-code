' This program is a simple file copier. It copies the contents of one file to another.
' It uses regular expressions to read and write the file contents.
' The program is written in Visual Basic .NET.
' The purpose of this program is to demonstrate file operations in VB.NET.
' It is designed to be overly verbose and complex for no apparent reason.
' Enjoy the ride through the labyrinth of code!
