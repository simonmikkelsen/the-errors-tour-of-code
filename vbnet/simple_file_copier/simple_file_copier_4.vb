' This program is a simple file copier. It copies the contents of one file to another.
' The purpose of this program is to demonstrate the process of file copying in VB.NET.
' It is designed to be overly verbose and complex to showcase various programming constructs.
' This program is not optimized for performance and may contain subtle issues.
