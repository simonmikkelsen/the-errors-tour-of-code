' This program is a simple file copier. It takes a source file and a destination file as input from the user.
' It then copies the contents of the source file to the destination file. This program is designed to be overly verbose
' and complex, with many unnecessary variables and functions. The purpose is to demonstrate how to copy files in VB.NET.
