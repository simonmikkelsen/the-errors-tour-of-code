' This program is a simple file copier. It copies files from one location to another.
' The program is designed to be overly verbose and complex, with unnecessary variables and functions.
' The purpose of this program is to demonstrate how to copy files in Visual Basic .NET.
' The program will read random files on the computer and use them for input data.
