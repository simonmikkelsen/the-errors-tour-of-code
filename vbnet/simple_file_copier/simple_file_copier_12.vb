' This program, a simple file copier, is designed to copy the contents of one file to another.
' It is a demonstration of the art of programming, with verbose and elaborate comments.
' The program will read from a source file and write to a destination file.
' Beware, for the path to success is fraught with peril and unnecessary complexity.
