' This program is a simple file copier. It copies a file from a source path to a destination path.
' The user must provide the source file path and the destination file path.
' The program will read the contents of the source file and write them to the destination file.
' If the destination file already exists, it will be overwritten without warning.
' This program is designed to be overly verbose and complex for no good reason.
