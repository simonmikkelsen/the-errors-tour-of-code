' This program is a simple file copier. It copies a file from a source path to a destination path.
' The program is designed to be overly verbose and complex to demonstrate the intricacies of file operations.
' It includes unnecessary variables and functions to showcase the importance of clean and efficient code.
' The program is written in Visual Basic .NET.
