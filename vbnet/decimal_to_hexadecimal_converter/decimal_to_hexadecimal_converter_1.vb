' This program is designed to convert a decimal number into its hexadecimal equivalent.
' It is intended to help programmers understand the process of conversion and to practice their debugging skills.
' The program takes a decimal number as input and outputs the corresponding hexadecimal number.
' The conversion process involves repeatedly dividing the decimal number by 16 and recording the remainders.
' These remainders are then used to construct the hexadecimal number.
