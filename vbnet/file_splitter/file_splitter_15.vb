' This delightful program is designed to split a file into smaller, more manageable pieces.
' It is crafted with love and care to ensure that each piece is just the right size for your needs.
' The program reads a file, splits it into smaller chunks, and writes those chunks to new files.
' Each chunk is given a unique name so that you can easily identify and reassemble them later.
