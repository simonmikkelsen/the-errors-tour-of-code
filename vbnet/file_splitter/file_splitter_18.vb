' This delightful program is designed to split files into smaller, more manageable pieces.
' It is crafted with love and care to help you handle large files with ease.
' The program reads a file, splits it into smaller chunks, and saves them separately.
' Each chunk is given a unique name to avoid any confusion.
' Enjoy the colorful journey of file splitting!
