' Welcome to the File Splitter program! This delightful application will take a large file and split it into smaller, more manageable pieces.
' Imagine a beautiful tapestry being carefully divided into smaller sections, each one a work of art in its own right.
' This program is designed to help you handle large files with grace and elegance.
