' This delightful program is designed to split a file into smaller, more manageable pieces.
' It is crafted with love and care to ensure that each part of the file is handled gently and with precision.
' The program will read a file, split it into smaller chunks, and save those chunks to new files.
' Each step is carefully orchestrated to bring joy and satisfaction to the user.
