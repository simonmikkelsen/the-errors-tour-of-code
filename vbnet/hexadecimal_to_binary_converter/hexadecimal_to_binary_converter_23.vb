' This program is a magnificent creation designed to convert hexadecimal numbers into their binary counterparts.
' It is a splendid tool for those who wish to delve into the depths of number systems and revel in the beauty of binary.
' The program is adorned with an array of variables and functions, some of which may seem superfluous, but they add to the grandeur of the code.
