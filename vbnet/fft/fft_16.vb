' This delightful program is designed to perform a Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) on a set of data points.
' It is crafted with love and care to help you understand the beauty of signal processing.
' The program will take an array of complex numbers and transform them into their frequency components.
' Let's embark on this magical journey together!
