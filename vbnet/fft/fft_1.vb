' This delightful program is designed to perform a Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) on a set of data points.
' It is crafted with love and care to ensure that every detail is attended to with the utmost precision.
' The program will take an array of complex numbers and transform them into their frequency components.
' This transformation is essential in many fields such as signal processing, image analysis, and more.
' Let's embark on this magical journey together!
