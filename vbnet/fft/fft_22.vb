' This delightful program is designed to perform a Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) on a given set of data.
' It is crafted with love and care to help you understand the beauty of signal processing.
' The program will take an array of complex numbers and transform it into its frequency components.
' Along the way, we will use a plethora of variables and functions to make the journey as colorful as possible.
