' This program is called Lix Counter.
' The purpose of this program is to count the number of words and sentences in a given text.
' It then calculates the LIX readability index based on the word and sentence count.
' The LIX readability index is a measure of how difficult a text is to read.
' The higher the LIX index, the more difficult the text is to read.
