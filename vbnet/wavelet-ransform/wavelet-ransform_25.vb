' This delightful program is designed to perform a wavelet transform, a mathematical technique
' that transforms data into different frequency components. It is a beautiful and intricate
' process that allows us to analyze data in a more detailed and nuanced way. Imagine the waves
' of the ocean, each one unique and mesmerizing, coming together to create a stunning symphony
' of information. This program captures that essence and brings it to life in the digital realm.
