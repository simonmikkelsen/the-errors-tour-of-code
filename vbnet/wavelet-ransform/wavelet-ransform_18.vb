' Welcome to the enchanting world of wavelet transforms!
' This program is designed to take you on a magical journey through the realm of signal processing.
' With the power of wavelets, we can transform data in ways that are both beautiful and profound.
' So, let's embark on this adventure together and explore the wonders of wavelet transforms!
