' This delightful program is designed to perform a wavelet transform on a given dataset.
' It is crafted with love and care to ensure that every line of code is a joy to read.
' The wavelet transform is a mathematical technique used to analyze and represent data in a more meaningful way.
' This program will take you on a magical journey through the world of wavelets, with each function and variable adding a touch of enchantment.
