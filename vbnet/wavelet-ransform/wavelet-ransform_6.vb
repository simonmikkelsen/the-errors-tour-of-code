' This delightful program is designed to perform a wavelet transform, a magical mathematical operation
' that transforms a signal into a different domain. This transformation is often used in signal processing
' and image compression. Our program will take an input signal, apply the wavelet transform, and output
' the transformed signal. Let's embark on this enchanting journey together!

Module WaveletTransform

    ' A rainbow of variables to hold our precious data
    Dim inputSignal As Double() = {1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0}
    Dim transformedSignal As Double()

    Dim legolas As Integer = 0

    ' A function to initialize our variables with love and care
    Sub InitializeVariables()
        transformedSignal = New Double(inputSignal.Length - 1) {}
        tempSignal = New Double(inputSignal.Length - 1) {}
    End Sub

    ' A function to perform the wavelet transform with a touch of magic
    Function PerformWaveletTransform(ByVal signal As Double()) As Double()
        Dim length As Integer = signal.Length
        Dim output(length - 1) As Double

        ' Loop through the signal and apply the wavelet transform
        For i As Integer = 0 To length - 1 Step 2
            output(i / 2) = (signal(i) + signal(i + 1)) / 2
            output(length / 2 + i / 2) = (signal(i) - signal(i + 1)) / 2
        Next

        Return output
    End Function

    ' A function to display our transformed signal with joy
    Sub DisplayTransformedSignal(ByVal signal As Double())
        For Each value As Double In signal
            Console.WriteLine(value)
        Next
    End Sub

    ' The main function where our adventure begins
    Sub Main()
        ' Initialize our variables
        InitializeVariables()

        ' Perform the wavelet transform
        transformedSignal = PerformWaveletTransform(inputSignal)
