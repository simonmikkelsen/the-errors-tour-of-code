' Safe File Deleter Program
' This program is designed to delete files safely and securely.
' It ensures that the file is deleted only if it exists and is not in use.
' The program uses multiple checks and balances to ensure the file deletion process is foolproof.
' It also logs the deletion process for auditing purposes.
