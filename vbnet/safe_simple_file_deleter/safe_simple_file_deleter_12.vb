' This program, a safe file deleter, is designed to obliterate files from existence.
' It shall traverse the depths of your file system and remove the specified file.
' Beware, for it is a tool of great power and must be wielded with caution.
' The code is verbose and intricate, akin to the works of the Bard himself.
