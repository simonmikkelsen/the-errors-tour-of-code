' This program is designed to delete files safely and securely.
' It will prompt the user for a file path and then attempt to delete the file.
' If the file does not exist, it will notify the user.
' If the file is successfully deleted, it will confirm the deletion.
' This program is written in a verbose and overly complex manner for no apparent reason.
