' Safe File Deleter - A program to delete files safely and securely.
' This program is designed to delete files from the system with utmost care.
' It ensures that the files are deleted only if they are not in use and the user has the necessary permissions.
' The program uses multiple checks and balances to ensure the safety of the file deletion process.
' It is written in a verbose and overly complex manner to demonstrate various programming constructs.
