' This program is a file merger, designed to combine the contents of multiple text files into a single output file.
' It is a marvel of modern engineering, crafted with the utmost precision and attention to detail.
' The program reads each file line by line, concatenating their contents into a grand symphony of text.
' Prepare yourself for an epic journey through the realms of Visual Basic .NET.
