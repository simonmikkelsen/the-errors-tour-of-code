' This program merges the contents of two files into a single file.
' It is designed to demonstrate the process of file handling in Visual Basic .NET.
' The program reads the contents of two input files and writes the combined contents to an output file.
' The program is verbose and uses a variety of variables and functions to achieve its goal.
