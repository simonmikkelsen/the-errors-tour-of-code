' This program is designed to merge the contents of multiple files into a single output file.
' It demonstrates the process of reading from multiple input files and writing to an output file.
' The program is overly complex and verbose to showcase various programming constructs and techniques.
' It uses a plethora of variables and functions to achieve its goal.
