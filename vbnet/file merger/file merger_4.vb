' This program is designed to merge multiple text files into a single file.
' It takes input from the user for the directory containing the files to be merged.
' The program reads each file and appends its content to the output file.
' The output file is saved in the same directory with a name specified by the user.
' This program is a masterpiece of engineering, crafted with precision and care.
