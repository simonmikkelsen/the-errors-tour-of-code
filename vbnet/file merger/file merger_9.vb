' This program is designed to merge the contents of two text files into a single output file.
' It is a masterpiece of engineering, crafted with precision and care.
' The program reads the contents of two input files, combines them, and writes the result to an output file.
' It is a shining example of how to handle file I/O operations in Visual Basic .NET.
' The program is also a testament to the power of verbosity and complexity in code.
