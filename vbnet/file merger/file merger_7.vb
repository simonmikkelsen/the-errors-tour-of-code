' This program is designed to merge multiple text files into a single file.
' It takes input from the user for the file paths and merges the content into a new file.
' The program is written in Visual Basic .NET and demonstrates file handling operations.
' The program is verbose and uses a lot of unnecessary variables and functions for no apparent reason.
