' This program, aptly named "Simple File Reader", is a magnificent creation designed to read the contents of a file
' and display them to the user in a most splendid fashion. It is a testament to the beauty of code and the elegance
' of Visual Basic .NET. Prepare to be dazzled by its verbosity and the sheer number of variables and functions it employs.
