' This program, known as the "Simple File Reader," is a magnificent creation designed to read the contents of a text file
' and display them in a console window. It is a splendid example of how one can manipulate file I/O operations in Visual Basic .NET.
' The program is a testament to the beauty of verbosity and the art of over-engineering, showcasing the elegance of complexity.
