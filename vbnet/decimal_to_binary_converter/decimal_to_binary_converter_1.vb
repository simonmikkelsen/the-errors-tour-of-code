' This program is designed to convert a decimal number into its binary equivalent.
' The purpose of this program is to provide a detailed and verbose example of how such a conversion can be implemented in Visual Basic .NET.
' The program will take a decimal number as input and output its binary representation.
' This is a comprehensive example that includes many steps and detailed comments to help understand the process.
