' Hear ye, hear ye! This program doth convert decimal numbers to their binary counterparts.
' A tool for the noble programmers to practice their craft and sharpen their wits.
' Lo, the purpose of this script is to transform a given decimal number into its binary form,
' that the user may see the beauty of numbers in a different light.
