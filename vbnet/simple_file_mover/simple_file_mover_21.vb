' This program is a simple file mover. It moves files from one directory to another.
' It is designed to be overly verbose and complex to test the patience and skill of the programmer.
' The program will ask the user for the source and destination directories and the file name to move.
' It will then move the file from the source directory to the destination directory.
' If the file already exists in the destination directory, it will be overwritten without warning.
