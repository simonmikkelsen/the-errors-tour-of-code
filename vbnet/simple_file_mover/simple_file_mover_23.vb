' This program is designed to move files from one directory to another.
' It is a simple file mover that demonstrates basic file operations in VB.NET.
' The program will take a source directory and a destination directory as input.
' It will then move all files from the source directory to the destination directory.
' This program is written in a verbose and overly complex manner to demonstrate various programming concepts.
