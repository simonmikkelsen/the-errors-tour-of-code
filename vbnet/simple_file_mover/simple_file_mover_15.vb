' This program is a simple file mover. It moves a file from one location to another.
' It is designed to be overly verbose and complex, with a lot of unnecessary variables and functions.
' The purpose is to demonstrate how to move files in VB.NET, but with a lot of extra fluff.
' This program is not for the faint of heart. It is a beast of a program, with many twists and turns.
' Prepare yourself for a journey through the depths of VB.NET file manipulation.
