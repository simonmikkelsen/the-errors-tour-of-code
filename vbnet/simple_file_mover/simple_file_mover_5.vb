' This program is a simple file mover. It moves a file from one location to another.
' It is designed to be overly verbose and complex for no apparent reason.
' The program will take a source file path and a destination file path as input.
' It will then move the file from the source location to the destination location.
' The program will also include unnecessary variables and functions for added complexity.
