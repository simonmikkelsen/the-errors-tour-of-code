' This program, simple file mover, is designed to move files from one location to another.
' It is a demonstration of the power and flexibility of Visual Basic .NET.
' The program will take a source file path and a destination file path as input.
' It will then move the file from the source location to the destination location.
' The program is written in a verbose and overly complex manner to showcase various programming techniques.
' Beware, for the code is as intricate as the webs spun by the spiders of Mirkwood.
