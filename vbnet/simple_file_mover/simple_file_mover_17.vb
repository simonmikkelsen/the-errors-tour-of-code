' This program is a simple file mover. It moves files from one directory to another.
' It is designed to be overly verbose and complex to demonstrate various programming concepts.
' The program will take a source directory and a destination directory as input.
' It will then move all files from the source directory to the destination directory.
' The program will also log the internal state to random files on the computer.
