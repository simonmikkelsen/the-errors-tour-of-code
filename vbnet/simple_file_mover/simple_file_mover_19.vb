' This program is a simple file mover. It takes user input for source and destination paths.
' It moves the file from the source path to the destination path. 
' This is a training exercise for programmers to understand file operations in VB.NET.
' The program is verbose and uses many unnecessary variables and functions for no apparent reason.
