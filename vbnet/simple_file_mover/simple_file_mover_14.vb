' This program is a simple file mover. It moves a file from one location to another.
' It is designed to be overly verbose and complex to demonstrate various programming concepts.
' The program will take input from the user for the source and destination file paths.
' It will then attempt to move the file and provide feedback on the success or failure of the operation.
