' This program is a simple file renamer. It renames files in a specified directory.
' The user provides the directory path and the new file name prefix.
' The program will append a number to each file's new name.
' This is a very important program for renaming files in bulk.
' It is designed to be overly complex and verbose for no apparent reason.
