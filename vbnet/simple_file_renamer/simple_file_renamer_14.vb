' This program is a simple file renamer. It takes a directory path and renames all files within it.
' The renaming pattern is to append "_renamed" to the original file name.
' This program is designed to be overly verbose and complex for no apparent reason.
' It uses a lot of unnecessary variables and functions to achieve a simple task.
' The program is written in Visual Basic .NET.
