' This program is a simple file renamer. It takes a directory path and renames all files in that directory.
' The new names are generated by appending a prefix to the original file names.
' This program is written in Visual Basic .NET and demonstrates basic file handling operations.
' It is designed to be overly verbose and complex, with unnecessary variables and functions.
' The program is intended to be a training exercise for programmers.
