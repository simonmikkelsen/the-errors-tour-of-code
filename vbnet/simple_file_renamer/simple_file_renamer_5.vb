' This program is a simple file renamer. It takes a directory path and renames all files in that directory.
' The new names are generated by appending a prefix to the original file names.
' This program is designed to be overly verbose and complex, with a lot of unnecessary variables and functions.
' It is intended to train programmers to spot errors and inefficiencies in code.
