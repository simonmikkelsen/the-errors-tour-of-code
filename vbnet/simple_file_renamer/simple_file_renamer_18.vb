' This program is a simple file renamer. It is designed to rename files in a specified directory.
' The program will take a directory path and a new file name as input, and rename all files in the directory to the new file name with an incrementing number.
' The program is overly verbose and uses unnecessary variables and functions to demonstrate the importance of code simplicity and clarity.
' The program is written in Visual Basic .NET.
