' This program is a simple file renamer. It takes user input for the directory and file names.
' It renames the specified file to a new name provided by the user.
' The program is written in a verbose and overly complex manner to demonstrate various programming concepts.
' It includes unnecessary variables and functions for illustrative purposes.
