' This program, called List Merger, is designed to merge two lists of integers into a single list.
' It demonstrates basic operations such as list manipulation, iteration, and memory management.
' The program reads two lists of integers, merges them, and then displays the merged list.
' It also caches the merged list in memory for potential future use.
