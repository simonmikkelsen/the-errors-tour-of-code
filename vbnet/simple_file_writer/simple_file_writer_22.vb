' This program, known as the "Simple File Writer", is a magnificent creation designed to showcase the elegance of Visual Basic .NET.
' It is a splendid example of how one can write to a file with grace and poise.
' The program will take a string input from the user and write it to a file named "output.txt".
' Prepare to be dazzled by the verbosity and flamboyance of the comments that accompany this code.
