/**
 * This delightful program performs a wavelet transform on a given array of data.
 * It is designed to be a gentle introduction to the enchanting world of wavelet transforms.
 * The program takes an array of numbers and applies the wavelet transform to it,
 * producing a transformed array that can be used for various purposes such as signal processing,
 * image compression, and more.
 * 
 * The wavelet transform is a magical mathematical technique that transforms data into different scales,
 * allowing us to analyze it in a more meaningful way. This program will guide you through the process
 * with love and care, ensuring that you understand each step along the way.
