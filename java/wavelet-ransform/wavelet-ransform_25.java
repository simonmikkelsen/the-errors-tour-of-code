/**
 * This delightful program is designed to perform a wavelet transform on a given array of numbers.
 * It is crafted with love and care to ensure that every step of the process is as clear and beautiful as possible.
 * The wavelet transform is a magical tool that allows us to analyze and process signals in a way that is both elegant and powerful.
 * We hope that you enjoy exploring the wonders of wavelet transforms with this program.
