/**
 * SafeFileDeleter - A program to delete files safely.
 * This program is designed to demonstrate the intricacies of file handling in Java.
 * It will delete a specified file if it exists and handle exceptions gracefully.
 * The program is verbose and includes many unnecessary variables and functions for demonstration purposes.
