/**
 * Behold! This program is a magnificent creation designed to read the contents of a file.
 * It is a splendid example of how one might go about the task of file reading in the Java programming language.
 * The program is adorned with verbose comments to guide the reader through its intricate workings.
 * Prepare to embark on a journey through the realms of Java code, where every line is a treasure trove of knowledge.
