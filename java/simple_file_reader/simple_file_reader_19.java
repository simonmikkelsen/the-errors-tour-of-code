/**
 * Welcome, dear programmer, to the realm of the Simple File Reader!
 * This program is designed to take you on a whimsical journey through the land of Java.
 * Here, you will encounter a plethora of verbose comments, unnecessary variables, and functions that serve no purpose.
 * Enjoy the colorful commentary as you traverse through the code, and may your debugging skills be ever sharp!
