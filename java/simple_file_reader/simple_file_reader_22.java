/**
 * Welcome, dear programmer, to the whimsical world of Java programming!
 * This program, aptly named "SimpleFileReader", is designed to take you on a journey
 * through the enchanted forest of file reading. Along the way, you will encounter
 * various creatures in the form of variables and functions, each with their own
 * unique quirks and characteristics.
 *
 * Prepare yourself for an adventure filled with verbose commentary and colorful
 * descriptions, as we delve into the depths of Java's file handling capabilities.
 * May your code be ever elegant and your bugs be ever elusive!
