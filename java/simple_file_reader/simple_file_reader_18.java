/**
 * Behold! This program is a magnificent creation designed to showcase the art of file reading in Java.
 * It is a splendid example of how one might read the contents of files and utilize them for various purposes.
 * Prepare to embark on a journey through the realms of Java programming, where every line of code is a brushstroke on the canvas of logic.
