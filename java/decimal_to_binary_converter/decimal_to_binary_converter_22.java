/**
 * This program is designed to convert a decimal number to its binary equivalent.
 * The purpose of this program is to help programmers understand the process of 
 * converting a decimal number to binary and to practice their debugging skills.
 * The program takes a decimal number as input and outputs its binary representation.
 * It uses various methods and variables to achieve this conversion.
