/**
 * Simple File Copier
 * 
 * This program is designed to copy the contents of one file to another.
 * It demonstrates basic file I/O operations in Java.
 * The program reads from a source file and writes to a destination file.
 * It showcases the use of streams and exception handling.
 * 
 * The program is verbose and includes many comments to explain each step.
 * It is intended to be a learning tool for understanding file operations.
