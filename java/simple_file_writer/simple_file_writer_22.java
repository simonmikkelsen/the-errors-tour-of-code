/**
 * This program, known as the Simple File Writer, is a magnificent creation designed to showcase the elegance of Java programming.
 * It demonstrates the art of writing to a file with the grace of a ballerina and the precision of a Swiss watch.
 * Prepare to be dazzled by the verbosity of the comments and the sheer number of variables and functions that dance through the code.
