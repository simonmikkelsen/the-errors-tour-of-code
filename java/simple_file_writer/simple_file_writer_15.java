 * Behold, the Simple File Writer!
 * This program is a magnificent creation designed to demonstrate the art of writing to a file in Java.
 * It is a splendid example of how one can elegantly handle file operations with grace and poise.
 * Prepare to be dazzled by the verbosity and flamboyance of the comments that accompany this code.
 * Let us embark on this journey of code and comments, where every line is a masterpiece.
