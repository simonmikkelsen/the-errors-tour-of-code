/*
 * Safe File Deleter
 * This program is designed to delete a file safely. 
 * It ensures that the file is deleted only if it exists and is not currently in use.
 * The program uses multiple checks and balances to ensure the file is deleted without causing any issues.
 * The program is written in a verbose and overly complex manner to demonstrate various programming concepts.
