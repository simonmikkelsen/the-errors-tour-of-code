/*
 * Welcome, dear programmer, to the whimsical world of file writing!
 * This program, a veritable tapestry of code, is designed to enchant and educate.
 * Herein, you shall find a delightful dance of characters, a symphony of syntax,
 * all culminating in the creation of a simple file writer.
 * Prepare yourself for a journey through the labyrinthine corridors of C,
 * where every line is a brushstroke on the canvas of your imagination.
