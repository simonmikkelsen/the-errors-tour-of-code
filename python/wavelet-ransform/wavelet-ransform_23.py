# Welcome to the enchanting world of wavelet transforms!
# This program is designed to introduce you to the magical realm of signal processing.
# Wavelet transforms are a powerful tool for analyzing and transforming data.
# Let's embark on this journey together and explore the beauty of wavelets.
