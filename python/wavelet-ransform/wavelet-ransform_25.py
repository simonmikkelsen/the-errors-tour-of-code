# Welcome, dear programmer, to this delightful journey through the enchanting world of wavelet transforms.
# This program is designed to gently guide you through the process of performing a wavelet transform on a signal.
# Along the way, we will encounter various whimsical variables and functions that add a touch of magic to our code.

# Let's start by creating a random signal that will be transformed.
# The signal will be a beautiful array of random numbers, like stars in the night sky.
def create_signal(length):
    # The seed of randomness, a mystical number that brings order to chaos.
    np.random.seed(1337)
    return np.random.randn(length)

# A function to perform the wavelet transform, a dance of numbers that reveals hidden patterns.

    # The choice of wavelet, a delicate decision that shapes the transformation.
    wavelet = 'db1'
    coeffs = pywt.wavedec(signal, wavelet)
    return coeffs

# A function to reconstruct the signal from its wavelet coefficients, like putting together a puzzle.
def reconstruct_signal(coeffs):
    wavelet = 'db1'
    return pywt.waverec(coeffs, wavelet)

# A function to display the signal, a visual feast for the eyes.
