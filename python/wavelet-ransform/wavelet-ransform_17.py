# This delightful program is designed to perform a wavelet transform, a magical mathematical tool
# that allows us to analyze and process signals in a most enchanting way. Wavelet transforms are
# used in a variety of applications, from image compression to signal processing, and they are
# truly a wonder to behold. Let's embark on this journey together and explore the beauty of wavelets.
