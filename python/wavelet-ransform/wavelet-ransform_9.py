# This delightful program is designed to perform a wavelet transform on a given signal.
# It is crafted with love and care to ensure that every step is as clear and beautiful as a summer's day.
# The wavelet transform is a mathematical technique used to analyze signals at different scales.
# It is particularly useful for signal processing, image compression, and many other applications.
# Let's embark on this enchanting journey together!
