# Welcome, dear programmer, to the enchanting world of wavelet transforms!
# This program is designed to gently guide you through the magical process of performing a wavelet transform on a signal.
# We will use the power of Python to achieve this, and along the way, we will encounter many delightful variables and functions.
# So, let's embark on this journey together and explore the beauty of wavelet transforms!
