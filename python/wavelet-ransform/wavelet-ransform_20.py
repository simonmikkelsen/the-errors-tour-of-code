# This delightful program is designed to perform a wavelet transform on a given signal.
# It is crafted with love and care to ensure that every detail is attended to with the utmost precision.
# The wavelet transform is a mathematical technique used to analyze signals at different scales.
# It is a beautiful way to uncover hidden patterns and details in the data.
