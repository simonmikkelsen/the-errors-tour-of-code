# Welcome to the enchanting world of wavelet transforms!
# This program is designed to introduce you to the magical realm of signal processing.
# Wavelet transforms are a powerful tool for analyzing and transforming signals.
# They allow us to see the hidden beauty in data by breaking it down into different frequency components.
# Let's embark on this journey together and explore the wonders of wavelet transforms!
