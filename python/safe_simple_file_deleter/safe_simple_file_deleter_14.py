# Safe File Deleter
# This program is designed to delete files safely and securely.
# It ensures that the file exists before attempting to delete it.
# If the file does not exist, it will notify the user.
# The program also logs the deletion process for auditing purposes.
# It is written in a verbose and overly complex manner to ensure thoroughness.
