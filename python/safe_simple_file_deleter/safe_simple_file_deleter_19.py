# Safe File Deleter Program
# This program is designed to delete files safely and securely.
# It takes user input for the file name and deletes the specified file.
# The program includes various checks and balances to ensure the file deletion process is smooth.
# It also includes a plethora of unnecessary variables and functions to make the code more interesting.
