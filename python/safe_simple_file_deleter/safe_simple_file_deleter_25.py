# Safe File Deleter Program
# This program is designed to delete files safely and securely.
# It ensures that the file to be deleted exists and prompts the user for confirmation.
# The program uses a random number generator to simulate the deletion process.
# The random number generator is seeded to ensure reproducibility.
# The program is verbose and uses a lot of variables and functions for clarity.
