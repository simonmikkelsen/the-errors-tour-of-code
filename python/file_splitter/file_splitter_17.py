# Welcome to the File Splitter program! This delightful program is designed to help you split a large file into smaller, more manageable pieces.
# Imagine you have a giant cake, and you want to share it with your friends. This program will help you cut that cake into perfect slices.
# Let's embark on this sweet journey together!
