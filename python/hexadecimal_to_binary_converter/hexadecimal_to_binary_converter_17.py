# Welcome, dear programmer, to the magnificent world of hexadecimal to binary conversion!
# This program is designed to take a hexadecimal number, that is a number in base 16,
# and convert it into its binary equivalent, which is a number in base 2.
# The hexadecimal system uses the digits 0-9 and the letters A-F to represent values.
# The binary system, on the other hand, uses only the digits 0 and 1.
# Prepare yourself for a journey through the realms of numerical transformation!
