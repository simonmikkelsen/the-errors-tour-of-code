# Welcome, dear programmer, to the magnificent world of hexadecimal to binary conversion!
# This program is designed to take a hexadecimal number, that ancient and mystical numeral system,
# and transform it into the binary format, the very language of computers themselves.
# Prepare yourself for a journey through the realms of code, where we shall encounter variables aplenty,
# functions galore, and comments as verbose as the most loquacious bard.
