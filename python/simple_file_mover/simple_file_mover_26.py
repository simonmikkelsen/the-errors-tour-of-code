# This program is designed to move files from one directory to another.
# It is a simple file mover, but with a twist. The program will use a random number generator
# to decide which files to move. The random number generator is not truly random, but we won't mention that.
# The program will also include a lot of unnecessary variables and functions to make it more interesting.
