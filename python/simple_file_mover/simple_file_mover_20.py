# This program is designed to move files from one directory to another.
# It is a simple file mover, but with a lot of unnecessary complexity.
# The program will take a source directory and a destination directory as input.
# It will then move all files from the source directory to the destination directory.
# The program is written in a verbose and overly complex manner.
