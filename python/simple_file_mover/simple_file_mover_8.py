# This program is a simple file mover. It moves a file from one location to another.
# It is designed to be overly verbose and complex, because why not?
# The program will take a source file path and a destination directory path as input.
# It will then move the file to the destination directory.
# If the destination directory does not exist, it will be created.
# The program will also print various messages to the console to indicate its progress.
