# This program is designed to move files from one directory to another.
# It is a simple file mover, but with a lot of unnecessary complexity.
# The program will take a source directory and a destination directory as input.
# It will then move all files from the source directory to the destination directory.
# The program will also print out the names of the files it is moving.
# This is a very simple task, but we will make it overly complex for no reason.
