# Welcome, dear programmer, to the whimsical world of the Simple File Reader!
# This program is designed to take you on a journey through the enchanted forest of file handling in Python.
# Along the way, you will encounter various creatures such as functions, variables, and loops.
# Your mission, should you choose to accept it, is to navigate this forest and emerge victorious with newfound knowledge.
