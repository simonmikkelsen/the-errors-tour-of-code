# Welcome, dear programmer, to the magnificent world of file reading!
# This program, aptly named "Simple File Reader," is designed to showcase the elegance and intricacies of reading files in Python.
# Prepare yourself for a journey through the realms of code, where every line is a step towards enlightenment.

    # Behold! The function that shall open the gates to the contents of the file.
    # It takes a single, humble parameter: the path to the file you wish to read.

        file = open(file_path, 'r')

        lines = file.readlines()
        
        # We shall now traverse the lines with the grace of a swan gliding across a serene lake.
        for line in lines:
            # Each line is printed with the enthusiasm of a thousand suns.
            print(line.strip())
