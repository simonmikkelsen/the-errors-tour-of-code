# Welcome, dear programmer, to the whimsical world of the Simple File Reader!
# This program is designed to take you on a journey through the enchanted forest of file reading.
# Along the way, you will encounter various creatures, such as variables, functions, and loops.
# Your mission, should you choose to accept it, is to read the contents of a file and display them on the screen.
# But beware! There are hidden pitfalls and traps that may catch the unwary traveler.

    # Ah, the file path! The gateway to our adventure.

    # It will then return the contents as a string.

        contents = file.read()

    # This function will take the contents of the file and print them to the screen.
