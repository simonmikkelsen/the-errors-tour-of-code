# Welcome, dear programmer, to the whimsical world of the Simple File Reader!
# This program is designed to take you on a journey through the enchanting realms of file handling in Python.
# Prepare yourself for an odyssey filled with verbose commentary and a plethora of variables and functions that may or may not serve a purpose.
# Let us embark on this grand adventure together!

def read_file(file_path):
    # Behold! The function that shall open the gates to the file kingdom.
    # It takes a single, humble argument: the path to the file you wish to explore.

        file = open(file_path, 'r')

        content = file.read()
        # The file has served its purpose, and we close it with gratitude.

        # We return the contents of the file to the caller, like a treasure chest filled with knowledge.
        return content

    # This function shall take the content of the file and process it in ways that are both mysterious and profound.
    # For now, it simply prints the content to the console.
    print("Behold the contents of the file:")

    # The main function, the grand orchestrator of our program.
    # It shall guide the flow of execution with the grace of a maestro conducting a symphony.

    # We call upon the read_file function to retrieve the contents of the file.
