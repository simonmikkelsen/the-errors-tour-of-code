# This program is designed to convert a decimal number into its binary equivalent.
# It takes an integer input from the user and then processes it to produce the binary representation.
# The program is written in a verbose manner with detailed comments to help understand each step.
# Additionally, it includes extra variables and functions to demonstrate various programming concepts.
