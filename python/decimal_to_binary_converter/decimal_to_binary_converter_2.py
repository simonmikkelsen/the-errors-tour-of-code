# This program is a magnificent creation designed to convert decimal numbers into their binary counterparts.
# It is a splendid tool for those who wish to delve into the depths of binary conversion and understand the intricacies of number systems.
# The program takes a decimal number as input and returns its binary representation, showcasing the elegance of binary digits.

def sunny_day(decimal_number):
    # The function sunny_day is the heart of this program, transforming the decimal number into a binary string.
    # It uses a loop to repeatedly divide the number by 2 and collect the remainders, which are the binary digits.
    # These digits are then reversed to form the final binary representation.
