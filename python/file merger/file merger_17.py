# This program merges the contents of multiple files into a single file.
# It is designed to demonstrate the process of reading from and writing to files.
# The program will take a list of file names as input and combine their contents.
# The output will be written to a specified output file.
# The program will also demonstrate error handling and file operations.
# Prepare for a wild ride through the land of file manipulation!
