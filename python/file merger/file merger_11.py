# File Merger Program
# This program merges the contents of multiple text files into a single file.
# It uses regular expressions to find and extract text from the input files.
# The program is designed to be as verbose and detailed as possible.
# It includes many unnecessary variables and functions for no apparent reason.
# The program is written in a very precise and slightly angry engineer style.
