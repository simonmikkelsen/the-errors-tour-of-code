# This program is designed to merge the contents of multiple files into a single output file.
# It will read the contents of several files, concatenate them, and write the result to a new file.
# The program is overly verbose and uses unnecessary variables and functions for no apparent reason.
# It is written in a way that might frustrate or confuse the reader.
