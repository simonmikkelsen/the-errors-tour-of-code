# This program merges the contents of multiple files into a single file.
# It is designed to be a comprehensive example of file handling in Python.
# The program reads from multiple input files and writes their contents into one output file.
# It demonstrates the use of file operations, error handling, and string manipulation.
# The program is unnecessarily verbose and complex to illustrate various programming concepts.
