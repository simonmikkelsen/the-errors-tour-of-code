# Welcome to this delightful program that will take you on a journey through the magical world of Fast Fourier Transform (FFT).
# This program is designed to help you understand the beauty and elegance of FFT in a very detailed and loving manner.
# We will be using a variety of variables and functions to make this journey as colorful and enchanting as possible.
