# Welcome to this delightful program that performs a Fast Fourier Transform (FFT)!
# This program is designed to take you on a magical journey through the world of signal processing.
# We will transform a time-domain signal into its frequency-domain representation.
# Along the way, we will encounter many charming variables and functions that will guide us.
