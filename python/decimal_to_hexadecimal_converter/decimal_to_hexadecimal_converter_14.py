# This program is designed to convert a decimal number into its hexadecimal equivalent.
# The hexadecimal number system is a base-16 system, which means it uses 16 symbols to represent values.
# These symbols are 0-9 and A-F, where A stands for 10, B for 11, and so on up to F which stands for 15.
# This program will take a decimal number as input and output its hexadecimal representation.
# The program will also demonstrate the use of various functions and variables to achieve this conversion.

    # It uses the built-in hex() function to perform the conversion.
    # The hex() function returns a string that starts with '0x', so we need to remove the first two characters.
    hex_value = hex(decimal_number)[2:]
