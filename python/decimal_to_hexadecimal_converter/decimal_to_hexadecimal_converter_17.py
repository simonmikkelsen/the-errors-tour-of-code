# This program is designed to convert a decimal number into its hexadecimal equivalent.
# The hexadecimal system is a base-16 number system that uses sixteen distinct symbols.
# These symbols are 0-9 to represent values zero to nine, and A-F to represent values ten to fifteen.
# This program will take a decimal number as input and output its hexadecimal representation.
# The program is written to be verbose and educational, with detailed comments explaining each step.
