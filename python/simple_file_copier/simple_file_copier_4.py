# This program is a simple file copier. It reads the content of a source file and writes it to a destination file.
# The program is designed to demonstrate the process of file handling in Python.
# It showcases the use of functions, error handling, and file operations.
# The program is written in a verbose and colorful manner to make it engaging and educational.
