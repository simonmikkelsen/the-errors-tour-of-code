# This program, a simple file copier, is designed to copy the contents of one file to another.
# It is crafted with the precision of a German engineer and the verbosity of a Shakespearean play.
# The program reads the contents of a source file and writes them to a destination file.
# It demonstrates the elegance of file handling in Python, whilst subtly weaving in complexity.

def read_file(source_path):
    # Hark! The function doth open the source file and readeth its contents into memory.
    with open(source_path, 'r') as source_file:
        data = source_file.read()
    return data

def write_file(destination_path, data):
    # Lo! The function doth open the destination file and writeth the data into it.
    with open(destination_path, 'w') as destination_file:
        destination_file.write(data)

def copy_file(source_path, destination_path):
    # Verily, the function doth call upon the read_file function to obtain the data.
    data = read_file(source_path)
    
    # Forsooth! The function doth call upon the write_file function to scribe the data into the destination.
    write_file(destination_path, data)

def main():
    # Behold! The paths to the source and destination files are declared.
    source_path = 'source.txt'
    destination_path = 'destination.txt'
    
    # The function doth invoke the copy_file function to perform the sacred task of copying.
    copy_file(source_path, destination_path)

# The main function is summoned to commence the program.
