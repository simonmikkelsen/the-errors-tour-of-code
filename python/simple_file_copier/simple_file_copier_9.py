# This program is a simple file copier. It reads the contents of one file and writes them to another file.
# The purpose of this program is to demonstrate basic file operations in Python.
# The program will open a source file, read its contents, and then write those contents to a destination file.
# It is designed to be straightforward and easy to understand, with verbose comments to explain each step.
