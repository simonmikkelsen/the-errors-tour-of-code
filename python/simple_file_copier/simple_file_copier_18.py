# This Python program is designed to copy the contents of one file to another.
# It is a simple file copier that demonstrates basic file operations.
# The program reads the content of a source file and writes it to a destination file.
# The purpose is to provide a clear example of file handling in Python.
# The program is written in a verbose and colorful style to enhance readability and understanding.
