# This Python program is a simple file copier. It reads the content of a source file and writes it to a destination file.
# The program is designed to demonstrate the process of file handling in Python.
# It showcases the use of functions, variables, and error handling in a verbose and colorful manner.

    # It opens the file in read mode and reads the content.
    # The content is then returned to the caller.

        content = file.read()
    return content

    # Function to write the content to the destination file.
    # It opens the file in write mode and writes the content.
    # The file is then closed automatically.

def copy_file(source_path, destination_path):

    # It calls the read_file function to get the content of the source file.
    # Then it calls the write_file function to write the content to the destination file.
