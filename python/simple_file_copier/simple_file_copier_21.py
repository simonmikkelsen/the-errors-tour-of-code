# This Python program is designed to copy the contents of one file to another.
# It is a simple file copier that demonstrates basic file operations.
# The program reads the content from a source file and writes it to a destination file.
# It is a practical example for understanding file handling in Python.
# The program is written in a verbose and colorful manner to enhance readability and understanding.
