# This Python program, named "simple file copier", is designed to copy the contents of one file to another.
# The program demonstrates the process of reading from a source file and writing to a destination file.
# It is a practical exercise for understanding file operations in Python.
# The program is written with verbose comments to guide the user through each step of the process.

def read_file(source_path):
    # This function reads the contents of the source file.
    # It takes the path of the source file as an argument.
    # It returns the contents of the file as a string.
    with open(source_path, 'r') as file:
        content = file.read()
    return content

def write_file(destination_path, content):
    # This function writes the given content to the destination file.
    # It takes the path of the destination file and the content to be written as arguments.
    # It ensures that the content is written to the file.
    with open(destination_path, 'w') as file:
        file.write(content)

def copy_file(source_path, destination_path):
    # This function orchestrates the file copying process.
    # It reads the content from the source file and writes it to the destination file.
    # It uses the read_file and write_file functions to perform these operations.

    # It defines the source and destination file paths.
    # It calls the copy_file function to perform the file copying operation.
