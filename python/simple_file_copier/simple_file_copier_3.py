# This Python program, named simple file copier, is designed to copy the contents of one file to another.
# It is a demonstration of file handling operations in Python, showcasing the opening, reading, writing, and closing of files.
# The program is written in a verbose and colorful manner, with an emphasis on clarity and detail.

def read_file(source_file):
    # This function reads the content of the source file and returns it.
    # It opens the file in read mode, reads the content, and then closes the file.
    # The content is stored in a variable named 'content' and returned to the caller.
    content = ""
    with open(source_file, 'r') as file:
        content = file.read()
    return content

def write_file(destination_file, content):
    # This function writes the given content to the destination file.
    # It opens the file in write mode, writes the content, and then closes the file.
    # The content is written to the file using the write() method.
    with open(destination_file, 'w') as file:
        file.write(content)

def main():
    # The main function orchestrates the file copying process.
    # It defines the source and destination file paths, reads the content from the source file,
    # and writes the content to the destination file.
    # The source file is named 'source.txt' and the destination file is named 'destination.txt'.
    source_file = 'source.txt'
    destination_file = 'destination.txt'
    
    # Reading the content from the source file
    content = read_file(source_file)
    
    # Writing the content to the destination file
    write_file(destination_file, content)
    
    # Additional verbose and colorful comments
    # The program has successfully copied the content from the source file to the destination file.
    # The source file remains unchanged, while the destination file now contains the same content as the source file.
    # This demonstrates the basic file handling operations in Python.
