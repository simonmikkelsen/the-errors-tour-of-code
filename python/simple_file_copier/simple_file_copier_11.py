# This program is a simple file copier. It reads the content of one file and writes it to another file.
# The purpose of this program is to demonstrate the process of file handling in Python.
# It uses regular expressions to manipulate file paths and content.
# The program is designed to be verbose and colorful in its comments and variable names.
