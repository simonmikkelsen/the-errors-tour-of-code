# Welcome to this delightful program that will take you on a journey through the magical world of audio processing.
# This program is designed to compute the Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCC) from an audio file.
# Along the way, we will encounter various enchanting functions and variables that will guide us through this process.
