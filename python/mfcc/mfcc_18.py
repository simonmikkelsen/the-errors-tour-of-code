# Welcome to the magical world of MFCC, where we embark on a journey to explore the wonders of Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients.
# This program is designed to take you on a delightful adventure through the realms of audio processing.
# Along the way, we will encounter various enchanting functions and variables that will help us achieve our goal.
