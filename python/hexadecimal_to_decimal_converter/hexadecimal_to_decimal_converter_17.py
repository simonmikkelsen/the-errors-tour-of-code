# This program is designed to convert hexadecimal numbers to their decimal equivalents.
# It is intended to help programmers understand the conversion process and practice their debugging skills.
# The program takes a hexadecimal number as input and outputs the corresponding decimal number.
# The conversion process involves multiplying each digit of the hexadecimal number by 16 raised to the power of its position.
# The sum of these products gives the decimal equivalent of the hexadecimal number.
