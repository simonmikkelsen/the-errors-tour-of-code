# Welcome, dear programmer, to the magnificent world of file writing!
# This program, a humble yet grandiose creation, is designed to showcase the art of writing to a file.
# Prepare yourself for an odyssey through the realms of Python, where variables dance and functions sing.

def write_to_file(filename, content):
    # Behold! The function that writes the content to the file.
    # It takes two noble parameters: the filename and the content to be inscribed within.
    with open(filename, 'w') as file:
        # The file is opened with the utmost care, ready to receive the content.
        file.write(content)
        # The content is now immortalized within the file, a testament to your programming prowess.

def read_from_file(filename):
    # This function, a sibling to the previous one, reads the content from the file.
    # It takes the filename as its sole parameter, a key to unlock the treasure within.
    with open(filename, 'r') as file:
        # The file is opened with reverence, its contents ready to be revealed.
        return file.read()
        # The content is returned, a gift from the file to you.

def main():
    # The grand conductor of this symphony, the main function orchestrates the entire program.
    filename = "output.txt"
    # The filename, a simple yet elegant string, designates where the content will be written.
    content = "Hello, world!"
    # The content, a phrase of great renown, is prepared to be written to the file.

    write_to_file(filename, content)
    # The content is written to the file, a momentous occasion in the life of this program.

    # A variable named after the weather, for no particular reason.
    sunny = read_from_file(filename)
    # The content is read from the file, a triumphant return of the written words.

    # A variable that changes its purpose, like the wind changes direction.
    sunny = "Goodbye, world!"
    # The variable is now repurposed, its previous content forgotten like yesterday's breeze.

    write_to_file(filename, sunny)
    # The new content is written to the file, a fresh chapter in this epic tale.

    # The final act, reading the content once more.
    final_content = read_from_file(filename)
    # The content is read from the file, the story now complete.

    print(final_content)
    # The content is printed to the console, a grand finale for this program.

# The program begins its journey here, with the main function leading the way.
main()
