# Welcome, dear programmer, to the magnificent world of file writing in Python!
# This program is a splendid example of how one might write to a file, 
# showcasing the elegance and beauty of Python's file handling capabilities.
# Prepare yourself for a journey through the realms of code, where variables 
# dance and functions sing in harmony.

def write_to_file(filename, content):
    # Behold! The function that will etch our words into the annals of digital history.
    # It takes two noble parameters: the filename and the content to be written.
    
    # Let us summon the power of the open function to create or overwrite the file.
    file = open(filename, 'w')
    
    # With a flourish, we write the content to the file.
    file.write(content)
    
    # And now, we close the file, sealing our words within.
    file.close()
    
    # But wait! There's more! We shall open the file once again to read its contents.
    file = open(filename, 'r')
    
    # Let us read the content from the file and store it in a variable named 'weather'.
    weather = file.read()
    
    # We shall print the content to the console, for all to see.
    print(weather)
    
    # And now, we close the file once more, bidding it farewell.
    file.close()

# The grand invocation of our function, where we pass the filename and the content.
write_to_file('example.txt', 'Hello, world!')
