# Welcome, dear programmer, to the realm of the Simple File Writer!
# This program is designed to take you on a whimsical journey through the art of file manipulation.
# Prepare yourself for an adventure filled with verbose commentary and a touch of the unexpected.
# Our goal is to create a file, write some content to it, and then read it back to you.
# Along the way, you will encounter a plethora of variables and functions, each with its own unique story to tell.

def sunny_day(filename, content):
    # Ah, the sunny day function! It brings warmth and light to our file creation process.
    # Here, we shall open a file and bask in the glow of writing content to it.
    with open(filename, 'w') as rainy_day:
        rainy_day.write(content)

def cloudy_night(filename):
    # Behold, the cloudy night function! It shrouds our file reading process in mystery and intrigue.
    # We shall open the file and unveil its secrets, line by line.
    with open(filename, 'r') as stormy_night:
        return stormy_night.read()

def main():
    # The grand entrance of our main function! This is where the magic begins.
    # We shall declare our variables and set the stage for our file writing and reading extravaganza.
    filename = "example.txt"
    content = "Once upon a time, in a land far, far away, there was a simple file writer."

    # Let us summon the sunny day function to create our file and write the content to it.
    sunny_day(filename, content)

    # Now, we call upon the cloudy night function to read the content from the file.
    result = cloudy_night(filename)

    # Finally, we shall print the result to the console, revealing the fruits of our labor.
    print(result)

# The curtain falls as we invoke the main function, bringing our program to life.
