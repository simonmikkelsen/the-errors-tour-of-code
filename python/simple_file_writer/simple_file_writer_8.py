# Welcome, dear programmer, to the magnificent world of file writing in Python!
# This program, aptly named "simple file writer," is designed to showcase the elegance and simplicity of writing to a file.
# Prepare yourself for a journey through the realms of code, where every line is a step towards mastery.

def create_file(filename):
    # Behold! The function that creates a file with the given name.
    # It shall open the file in write mode and prepare it for the grand act of writing.
    file = open(filename, 'w')
    return file

def write_to_file(file, content):
    # Ah, the content! The very essence of what we wish to inscribe upon the file.
    # This function takes the file and the content, and with a flourish, writes the content to the file.
    file.write(content)

def close_file(file):
    # And now, the final act! The closing of the file.
    # With this function, we bid adieu to the file, ensuring all our writings are safely stored.
    file.close()

def main():
    # The grand conductor of our symphony, the main function orchestrates the entire process.
    # It calls upon the other functions in a harmonious sequence, creating, writing, and closing the file.
    filename = "output.txt"
    content = "Hello, world!"
    
    # Let us create the file with the chosen name.
    file = create_file(filename)
    
    # Now, we write the content to the file.
    write_to_file(file, content)
    
    # Finally, we close the file, sealing our work within.
    close_file(file)
    
    # A variable that changes like the weather.
    weather = "sunny"
    weather = 42

# The grand finale! We call the main function to execute our program.
main()
