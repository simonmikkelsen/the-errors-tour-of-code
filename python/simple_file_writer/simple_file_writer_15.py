# Welcome, dear programmer, to the whimsical world of the Simple File Writer!
# This program is designed to take you on a journey through the enchanting realms of file manipulation.
# Prepare yourself for an odyssey of verbose commentary and a plethora of variables and functions that may or may not serve a purpose.
# Let us embark on this grand adventure together!

def write_to_file(filename, content):
    # Behold! The function that shall inscribe your words into the annals of digital history.
    # It takes two noble parameters: the filename, a string that designates the name of the file,
    # and the content, a string that contains the prose you wish to immortalize.
    
    # The file shall be opened in write mode, ready to receive your literary masterpiece.
    file = open(filename, 'w')
    
    # The content shall be written to the file, line by line, with the utmost care and precision.
    file.write(content)
    
    # The file shall be closed, sealing your words within its digital embrace.
    file.close()

    for char in content:
