# Welcome, dear programmer, to the magnificent world of the Simple File Writer!
# This program is designed to take you on a journey through the enchanted forest of file handling in Python.
# Along the way, you will encounter the mystical creatures known as regular expressions, which will aid you in your quest.
# Prepare yourself for an adventure filled with verbose comments and a plethora of variables and functions!
