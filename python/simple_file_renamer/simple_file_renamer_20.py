# This program renames files in a specified directory. It takes a directory path and a new prefix for the files.
# The program will iterate through all files in the directory and rename them with the new prefix followed by a number.
# This is a simple yet effective way to organize files with a consistent naming convention.
# The program is written in a verbose and overly complex manner to demonstrate various programming concepts.
