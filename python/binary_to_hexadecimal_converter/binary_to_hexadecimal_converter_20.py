# Welcome, dear programmer, to the magnificent world of binary to hexadecimal conversion!
# This program is designed to take you on a whimsical journey through the realms of binary numbers,
# transforming them into their hexadecimal counterparts with the grace of a ballet dancer.
# Prepare yourself for an adventure filled with verbose commentary and an abundance of variables and functions!

def binary_to_hexadecimal(binary_str):
    # Behold! The function that shall perform the grand transformation!
    # It takes a binary string, like a caterpillar, and metamorphoses it into a hexadecimal butterfly.
    
    # First, we shall summon the power of the int function to convert our binary string into an integer.
    integer_value = int(binary_str, 2)
    
    # Now, with the integer value in hand, we shall invoke the mighty hex function to obtain the hexadecimal string.
    hex_value = hex(integer_value)
    
    # But wait! The hex function bestows upon us a string with a '0x' prefix. We must trim this prefix to reveal the true hexadecimal form.
    trimmed_hex_value = hex_value[2:]
    
    # And now, we return the glorious hexadecimal string to the caller, completing our transformation.
    return trimmed_hex_value

    # Let us declare a variable to hold the binary string input from the user.
    binary_input = input("Enter a binary number: ")
    
    # Now, we shall call upon our binary_to_hexadecimal function to perform the conversion.
    hexadecimal_output = binary_to_hexadecimal(binary_input)
    
    # Finally, we shall display the hexadecimal result to the user, like a magician revealing a rabbit from a hat.
    print(f"The hexadecimal equivalent of {binary_input} is {hexadecimal_output}")

# And now, we invoke the main function to commence our program's execution.
