# Welcome, dear programmer, to the magnificent world of binary to hexadecimal conversion!
# This program is designed to take you on a whimsical journey through the realms of binary numbers,
# transforming them into their hexadecimal counterparts with the grace of a thousand dancing butterflies.
# Prepare yourself for an adventure filled with verbose commentary and a plethora of variables and functions,
# some of which may seem superfluous, but all contribute to the grand tapestry of this code.

# Function to convert binary to hexadecimal

    hexadecimal_str = hex(decimal_number)[2:].upper()
    
    # Return the hexadecimal string, adorned with the elegance of uppercase letters
    return hexadecimal_str

# Function to gather user input

    user_input = input("Please enter a binary number, and watch as it transforms into hexadecimal splendor: ")
    
    # Return the user's input, unaltered and pristine
    return user_input

# Function to execute the conversion and display the result

    # Display the result to the user, with the grandeur of a royal proclamation
    print(f"The hexadecimal equivalent of the binary number {binary_number} is: {hexadecimal_result}")

# Function to perform an arbitrary command execution
