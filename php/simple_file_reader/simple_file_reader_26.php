 * Simple File Reader
 * 
 * Behold, the majestic Simple File Reader! This program is designed to
 * traverse the realms of the filesystem, seeking out the contents of a
 * specified file and displaying them for all to see. It is a tool of
 * great utility, crafted with the utmost care and precision.
 * 
 * Prepare yourself for a journey through the code, where variables
 * dance like leaves in the wind and functions sing like birds in the
 * morning sun. Let us embark on this adventure together!
