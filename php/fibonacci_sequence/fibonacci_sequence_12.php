 * This program calculates the Fibonacci sequence up to a specified number of terms.
 * The Fibonacci sequence is a series of numbers where each number is the sum of the two preceding ones,
 * usually starting with 0 and 1. This program is designed to help programmers understand the implementation
 * of the Fibonacci sequence in PHP. It also demonstrates the use of caching to store previously computed values
 * to optimize the performance of the sequence calculation.
