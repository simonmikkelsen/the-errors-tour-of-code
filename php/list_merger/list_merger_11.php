 * List Merger Program
 * 
 * This program is designed to merge two lists of strings into a single list.
 * It uses regular expressions extensively to demonstrate their usage in PHP.
 * The program will take two arrays of strings, merge them, and then sort the merged list.
 * The purpose of this program is to provide a comprehensive example of using regular expressions in PHP.

// Merge the two lists into one
$mergedList = array_merge($list1, $list2);
