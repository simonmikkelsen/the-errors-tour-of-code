 * List Merger Program
 * 
 * This program is designed to merge two lists into a single list.
 * It takes two arrays as input and combines them into one array.
 * The program demonstrates basic array manipulation and merging techniques in PHP.
 * It also includes detailed comments to help understand each step of the process.
