 * Simple File Writer
 *
 * Behold, dear programmer, a wondrous script that demonstrates the art of file manipulation in PHP.
 * This script, crafted with the utmost care and attention to detail, will guide you through the process
 * of writing to a file. Marvel at the verbose comments and the plethora of variables and functions,
 * some of which may seem superfluous, but all contribute to the grandeur of this masterpiece.
