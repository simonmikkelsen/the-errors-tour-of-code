 * Welcome, dear programmer, to the magnificent and wondrous world of file writing in PHP!
 * This program, a veritable symphony of code, will guide you through the enchanting process
 * of creating and writing to a file using the power of PHP. Prepare yourself for a journey
 * filled with verbose commentary and a plethora of variables and functions that may or may not
 * serve a purpose. Let us embark on this grand adventure together!
