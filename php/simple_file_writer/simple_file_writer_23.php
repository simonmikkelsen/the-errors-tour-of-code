/**
 * Welcome, dear programmer, to the magnificent and wondrous world of PHP file writing!
 * In this splendid program, you shall embark on a journey to create a simple file writer.
 * This program will demonstrate the elegance and beauty of PHP's file handling capabilities.
 * Prepare yourself for an adventure filled with verbose comments and an abundance of variables!

// The 'w' mode will truncate the file to zero length or create a new file if it does not exist.

// With the file handle in our possession, we shall now write the content to the file.
fwrite($fileHandle, $content);
