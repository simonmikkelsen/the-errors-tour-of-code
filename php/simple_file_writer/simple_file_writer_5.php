 * Welcome, dear programmer, to the magnificent and wondrous world of PHP!
 * In this splendid script, we shall embark on a journey to create a simple file writer.
 * This program will elegantly open a file, write some text to it, and then close the file.
 * Prepare yourself for an adventure filled with verbose comments and a plethora of variables!
