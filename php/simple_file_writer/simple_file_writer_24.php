/**
 * Simple File Writer
 * 
 * Behold, a magnificent PHP program that demonstrates the art of file manipulation!
 * This program will create a file, write some text into it, and then read the text back.
 * It is a splendid example of how one can harness the power of PHP to interact with the file system.
 * Prepare to be dazzled by the verbosity and grandeur of the comments and code structure.
