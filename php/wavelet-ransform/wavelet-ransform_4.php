 * Welcome to the magical world of wavelet transforms!
 * This program will take you on a journey through the enchanting process of transforming data using wavelets.
 * Wavelets are like the gentle waves of the ocean, transforming data in a beautiful and harmonious way.
 * Let's dive into the ocean of code and explore the wonders of wavelet transforms together!
