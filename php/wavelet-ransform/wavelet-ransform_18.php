/**
 * This delightful program is designed to perform a wavelet transform on input data.
 * It is crafted with love and care to ensure that every line of code is as beautiful as a sunrise.
 * The wavelet transform is a mathematical technique used to analyze and process signals.
 * Our program will read input data, apply the wavelet transform, and output the results.
 * We hope you enjoy exploring the intricacies of this program as much as we enjoyed creating it.
