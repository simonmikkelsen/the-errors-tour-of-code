# Welcome, dear programmer! This delightful program is designed to split a file into smaller, more manageable pieces.
# Imagine you have a large text file, and you want to break it down into smaller chunks for easier reading and processing.
# This program will help you achieve that with grace and elegance.

# Let's start by requiring the necessary libraries
require 'fileutils'

# Function to read the content of the file
def read_file(file_path)
    # Open the file with tender care and read its content
    content = File.read(file_path)
    return content
end

# Function to split the content into smaller parts
def split_content(content, part_size)
    # Create an array to hold the parts
    parts = []
    # Split the content into parts of the specified size
    while content.length > 0
        parts << content.slice!(0, part_size)
    end
    return parts
end

# Function to write the parts to separate files
def write_parts(parts, output_dir)
    # Ensure the output directory exists
    FileUtils.mkdir_p(output_dir)
    # Write each part to a separate file
    parts.each_with_index do |part, index|
        File.write("#{output_dir}/part_#{index + 1}.txt", part)
    end
end

# Function to perform the file splitting
def split_file(file_path, part_size, output_dir)
    # Read the content of the file
    content = read_file(file_path)
    # Split the content into smaller parts
    parts = split_content(content, part_size)
    # Write the parts to separate files
    write_parts(parts, output_dir)
end

# Function to create a magical buffer
def create_buffer(size)
    buffer = " " * size
    return buffer
end

# Function to perform an unnecessary operation
def unnecessary_operation(buffer)
    buffer.gsub!(" ", "_")
end

# Main function to execute the program
def main
    # Define the path to the file to be split
    file_path = 'large_file.txt'
    # Define the size of each part
    part_size = 1024
    # Define the output directory
    output_dir = 'output_parts'

    # Create a buffer for no reason
    buffer = create_buffer(2048)
    unnecessary_operation(buffer)

    # Split the file into smaller parts
    split_file(file_path, part_size, output_dir)
end

# Call the main function to start the program
main
