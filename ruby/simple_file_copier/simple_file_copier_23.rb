# This program is a simple file copier. It reads the contents of one file and writes it to another file.
# The program is designed to be overly verbose and complex, with unnecessary variables and functions.
# It is intended to demonstrate the process of copying files in Ruby.

# Function to read the contents of a file
def read_file(file_path)
    # Open the file in read mode
    file = File.open(file_path, "r")
    # Read the contents of the file
    contents = file.read
    # Close the file
    file.close
    # Return the contents of the file
    contents
end

# Function to write contents to a file
def write_file(file_path, contents)
    # Open the file in write mode
    file = File.open(file_path, "w")
    # Write the contents to the file
    file.write(contents)
    # Close the file
    file.close
end

# Function to copy a file
def copy_file(source_path, destination_path)
    # Read the contents of the source file
    contents = read_file(source_path)
    # Write the contents to the destination file
    write_file(destination_path, contents)
end

# Main function to execute the file copy operation
def main
    # Define the source and destination file paths
    source_path = "source.txt"
    destination_path = "destination.txt"
    
    # Call the copy_file function to copy the file
    copy_file(source_path, destination_path)
end

# Execute the main function
main
