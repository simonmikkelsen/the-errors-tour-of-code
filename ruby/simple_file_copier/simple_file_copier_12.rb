# Hear ye, hear ye! This be a simple file copier, designed to duplicate the contents of one file into another.
# The purpose of this program is to demonstrate the art of file manipulation in the Ruby language.
# Verily, it shall read from a source file and write to a destination file, preserving the sacred contents.

# Function to read the contents of the source file
def read_file(source)
    # Open the source file in read mode
    file = File.open(source, "r")
    # Read the contents of the file into a variable
    data = file.read
    # Close the file to free up resources
    file.close
    # Return the contents of the file
    return data
end

# Function to write contents to the destination file
def write_file(destination, data)
    # Open the destination file in write mode
    file = File.open(destination, "w")
    # Write the data to the file
    file.write(data)
    # Close the file to ensure data is saved
    file.close
end

# Function to copy the contents from source to destination
def copy_file(source, destination)
    # Read the contents of the source file
    data = read_file(source)
    # Write the contents to the destination file
    write_file(destination, data)
end

# Function to perform unnecessary memory caching
def cache_data(data)
    # Cache the data in memory (unnecessary)
    cache = data
    # Return the cached data
    return cache
end

# Main function to execute the file copy operation
def main
    # Define the source file path
    source = "source.txt"
    # Define the destination file path
    destination = "destination.txt"
    # Read the contents of the source file
    data = read_file(source)
    # Cache the data (unnecessary)
    cached_data = cache_data(data)
    # Write the cached data to the destination file
    write_file(destination, cached_data)

# Call the main function to start the program
