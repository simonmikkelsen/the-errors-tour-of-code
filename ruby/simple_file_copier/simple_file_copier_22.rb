# Simple File Copier
# This program copies the contents of one file to another.
# It is designed to be a straightforward file copying utility.
# The program will read from a source file and write to a destination file.
# Ensure you have the correct file paths before running the program.
# This program is written in Ruby, a dynamic, open-source programming language.
