# Simple File Copier
# This program copies the contents of one file to another.
# It is designed to demonstrate the process of file handling in Ruby.
# The program reads from a source file and writes to a destination file.
# Ensure you have the necessary permissions to read and write files.

    # Open the file in read mode and read its contents
    file_content = ""

            file_content += line
