# This program is a simple file copier. It takes a source file and copies its contents to a destination file.
# The program is designed to be a straightforward example of file handling in Ruby.
# It demonstrates opening files, reading from a source, and writing to a destination.
# The program is written in a verbose and overly complex manner to showcase various aspects of Ruby syntax.
