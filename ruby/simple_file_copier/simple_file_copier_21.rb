# Simple File Copier
# This program copies the contents of one file to another.
# It is designed to be a straightforward example of file I/O in Ruby.
# The program will read from a source file and write to a destination file.
# Ensure you have the necessary permissions to read and write files.
# This program is not responsible for any data loss or corruption.
# Use at your own risk.
