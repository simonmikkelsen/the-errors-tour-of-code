# This program is a simple file copier. It takes a source file and a destination file as input.
# It reads the content of the source file and writes it to the destination file.
# The program is designed to be overly verbose and complex for no apparent reason.
# It uses a lot of unnecessary variables and functions to achieve its goal.
