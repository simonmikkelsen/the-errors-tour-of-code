# This delightful program is designed to transform decimal numbers into their binary counterparts.
# It is a whimsical journey through the land of bits and bytes, where numbers dance and twirl into binary form.
# Along the way, we shall encounter various variables and functions, some of which may seem superfluous,
# but they all add to the charm and complexity of our adventure.

# Function to convert decimal to binary

    number = decimal
    
    # While our traveler has not yet reached the end of their journey...
    while number > 0
        # The remainder of the traveler's division by 2 is the next binary digit.
        remainder = number % 2
        
        # The binary string welcomes the new digit to its growing family.
        binary_string = remainder.to_s + binary_string
        
        # The traveler continues their journey, halving their number and pressing onward.
        number = number / 2
