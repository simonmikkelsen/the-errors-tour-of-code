# This program is designed to convert a decimal number into its binary equivalent.
# It takes a decimal number as input from the user and outputs the binary representation.
# The program is written in a verbose manner to help new programmers understand the flow of the code.
# It includes many comments to explain each step in detail.

# Function to convert decimal to binary
def decimal_to_binary(decimal)
    # Initialize an empty string to store the binary result
    binary_result = ""

    # Loop until the decimal number is greater than 0
    while decimal > 0
        # Get the remainder when the decimal number is divided by 2
        remainder = decimal % 2
        # Prepend the remainder to the binary result string
        binary_result = remainder.to_s + binary_result
        # Divide the decimal number by 2 and update the decimal variable
        decimal = decimal / 2
    end

    # Return the binary result
    binary_result
end

# Function to write internal state to random files

    end
