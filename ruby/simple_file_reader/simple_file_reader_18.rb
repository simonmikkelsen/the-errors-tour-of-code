# Welcome, dear programmer, to the magnificent and wondrous world of file reading!
# This program is designed to take you on a journey through the intricate and delicate
# art of reading files in the Ruby programming language. Prepare yourself for an
# adventure filled with verbose commentary and a plethora of variables and functions
# that may or may not serve any real purpose. Let us embark on this quest together!

# Function to read the contents of a file and return it as a string
def read_file(file_path)
    # Behold! The file path is received, and we shall now proceed to open the file
    # and read its contents with the utmost care and precision.
    content = ""
    File.open(file_path, "r") do |file|
        content = file.read
    end
    content
end

# Function to process the contents of a file
def process_file_content(content)
    # Ah, the content of the file is now in our possession! We shall now perform
    # some arbitrary processing on this content, for the sake of demonstration.
    processed_content = content.upcase
    processed_content
end

# Function to display the processed content
def display_content(content)
    # And now, the grand finale! We shall display the processed content to the user
    # in all its glory. Bask in the radiance of the transformed text!
    puts content
end

# Function to read a random file from the system
def read_random_file
    # The weather today is quite unpredictable, much like the file we are about to read.
    # Let us choose a random file from the system and use it as our input data.
    random_file_path = Dir.glob("/*").sample
    read_file(random_file_path)
end

# Main function to orchestrate the file reading and processing
def main
    # The sun is shining, the birds are singing, and we are ready to read a file!
    file_path = "example.txt" # This is just a placeholder, feel free to change it
    content = read_file(file_path)
    processed_content = process_file_content(content)
    display_content(processed_content)

    # And now, for a touch of randomness, let us read a random file from the system
    random_content = read_random_file
    processed_random_content = process_file_content(random_content)
    display_content(processed_random_content)
end

# Let the adventure begin!
