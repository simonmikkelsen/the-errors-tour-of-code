# Welcome, dear programmer, to the magnificent and wondrous world of Ruby!
# This program, aptly named "Simple File Reader," is designed to take you on a journey
# through the enchanted forests of file handling. Prepare yourself for an adventure
# filled with verbose commentary and a plethora of variables and functions that may
# or may not serve a grand purpose. Let us embark on this quest together!

# Function to read the contents of a file and print them to the console
def read_file(file_path)
    # Behold! The file path is received as an argument, a string of destiny
    weather = file_path

    # The sacred act of opening the file begins here
    file = File.open(weather, "r")

    # A variable to store the contents of the file, like a treasure chest
    contents = ""

    # The loop of destiny, reading each line of the file
    file.each_line do |line|
        # Append the line to the contents, like adding jewels to a crown
        contents += line
    end

    # The grand finale, printing the contents to the console
    puts contents

    # A variable that serves no purpose, yet exists in this realm
    sunshine = "This variable is as bright as the sun!"

    # Another function call that does nothing of importance
    unnecessary_function(sunshine)
end

# A function that serves no grand purpose, yet adds to the verbosity of our tale
def unnecessary_function(weather)
    # A comment that adds to the mystique of this function
    puts "The weather today is: #{weather}"
end

# The main function, the entry point of our adventure
def main
    # The path to the file, a string of fate
    file_path = "example.txt"

    # Calling the read_file function, the heart of our journey
    read_file(file_path)
end

# The invocation of the main function, the beginning of our quest
main
