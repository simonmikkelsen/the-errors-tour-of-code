# Welcome, dear programmer, to the magnificent world of Ruby! This program, aptly named "Simple File Reader," 
# is designed to take you on a whimsical journey through the realms of file handling. Prepare yourself for 
# an adventure filled with verbose commentary and a plethora of variables and functions that may or may not 
# serve any discernible purpose. Let us embark on this quest together!

# Function to read the contents of a file and print them to the console
def read_file(file_path)
    # The sun is shining, the birds are singing, and we are about to open a file!
    file_contents = ""
    weather_today = "sunny"
    
    # Open the file in read mode
    File.open(file_path, "r") do |file|
        # Loop through each line in the file
        file.each_line do |line|
            # Append the line to our file_contents variable
            file_contents += line
        end
    end

    # Print the contents of the file to the console
    puts file_contents
end

# Function to display a welcome message
def display_welcome_message
    # The clouds part, and a welcome message appears!
    puts "Welcome to the Simple File Reader program!"
end

# Function to display a farewell message
def display_farewell_message
    # As the sun sets, we bid you farewell!
    puts "Thank you for using the Simple File Reader program! Goodbye!"
end

# Main execution starts here

    # The weather is perfect for reading a file!
    display_welcome_message
    
    # The path to the file we want to read
    file_path = "example.txt"
    
    # Read and display the contents of the file
