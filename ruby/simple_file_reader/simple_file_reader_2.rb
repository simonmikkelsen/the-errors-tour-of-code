# Welcome, noble programmer, to the realm of the Simple File Reader!
# This majestic script is designed to unfurl the scrolls of text files,
# revealing their hidden contents to the discerning eye of the coder.
# Prepare yourself for a journey through the enchanted forest of Ruby code,
# where each line is a stepping stone and each variable a mystical creature.

# Behold, the entrance to our script, where we require the necessary artifacts.

# The grand function that initiates the reading of the sacred file.
def read_file(file_path)
    # Here we declare our variables, like knights preparing for battle.

    # The file is opened, and its contents are read into the buffer.
    File.open(file_path, "r") do |file|
        while (line = file.gets)
            # Each line is added to the content, like a bard adding verses to a song.
            content += line
            buffer = line
        end
    end

    # The content is returned, a treasure trove of knowledge.
