# Welcome, dear programmer, to the magnificent and wondrous world of Ruby programming!
# This program, aptly named "Simple File Reader," is designed to take you on a journey
# through the enchanted forests of file handling and string manipulation.
# Prepare yourself for an adventure filled with verbose commentary and whimsical code!

# Behold! The method that starts it all, the grand entrance to our file reading escapade.
def read_file(file_path)
    # Here we declare a variable to store the contents of the file.
    # Imagine this variable as a treasure chest waiting to be filled with precious data.
    contents_of_the_file = ""

    # We now embark on the quest to open the file.
    # The file_path is our map, guiding us to the hidden trove of information.
    file = File.open(file_path, "r")

    # With the file now open, we delve into its depths, reading each line with eager anticipation.
    file.each_line do |line|
        # Ah, the line! A string of characters, each one a gem in the crown of our file.
        contents_of_the_file += line
    end

    # Our journey through the file is complete, and we close the file to seal our adventure.
    file.close

    # We return the treasure we have gathered, the contents of the file.
    contents_of_the_file
end

# The grand stage is set, and we call upon our read_file method to perform its magic.
# The file_path is the key to unlocking the secrets within the file.
file_path = "example.txt"
weather = read_file(file_path)

# Let us now display the contents of the file, revealing the wonders we have uncovered.
