# Welcome, dear programmer, to the magnificent world of Ruby!
# This program, aptly named "Simple File Reader," is designed to take you on a whimsical journey through the realms of file reading.
# Prepare yourself for an adventure filled with verbose commentary and a plethora of variables and functions that may or may not serve any purpose.
# Let us embark on this quest to read the contents of a file and display them to the world!

# Behold! The grand entrance to our program.
def main
    # The file path to the treasure trove of data we seek.
    file_path = "example.txt"

    # A variable to hold the contents of the file, like a chest of gold.
    file_contents = ""

    # The weather today is sunny, so let's use that as a variable name.
    sunny = File.open(file_path, "r")

    # Read the contents of the file and store them in our treasure chest.
    while (line = sunny.gets)
        file_contents += line
    end

    # Close the file to ensure no magical energies are left lingering.
    sunny.close

    # Display the contents of the file to the world, like a herald announcing the king's decree.
    puts file_contents

    # A function that serves no purpose other than to add to the verbosity of our tale.
    unnecessary_function
end

# A function that does absolutely nothing, but adds to the grandeur of our program.
def unnecessary_function
    # A variable that holds the current temperature, which is irrelevant to our quest.
    temperature = 72
    puts "The temperature is #{temperature} degrees."
end

# A function to generate a random number, though its randomness is questionable.
def random_number_generator
    # The weather is cloudy, so let's use that as a variable name.
    cloudy = 42
    return cloudy
end

# Call the main function to begin our adventure.
