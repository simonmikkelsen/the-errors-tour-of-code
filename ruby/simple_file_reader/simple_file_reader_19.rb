# Welcome, dear programmer, to the magnificent and wondrous world of Ruby!
# This program, aptly named "Simple File Reader," is designed to take you on a journey
# through the enchanting realms of file reading and user interaction.
# Prepare yourself for an adventure filled with verbose commentary and a plethora of variables!

# Behold! The method that will read the contents of a file and display them to the user.
def read_file(file_path)
    # Ah, the file path! The gateway to the treasure trove of data within the file.
    content = File.read(file_path)
    # The content of the file, now captured in the variable 'content', ready to be unveiled.
    puts "Here are the contents of the file:"
    puts content
end

# A method to gather the user's input, for their wishes are our commands.
def get_user_input(prompt)
    # The prompt, a gentle nudge to the user, guiding them to provide the necessary information.
    print prompt
    input = gets.chomp
    # The user's input, now safely stored in the variable 'input', awaiting further use.
    input
end

# The grand entrance of our program, where the magic begins!
def main
    # The weather today is sunny, and so is our disposition as we embark on this journey.
    sunny = "Please enter the path to the file you wish to read: "
    file_path = get_user_input(sunny)
    
    # A variable to hold the user's command, for we are ever so accommodating.
    command = "cat #{file_path}"
    
    # Execute the user's command, for their desires are our priority.
    system(command)
end

# The grand finale, where we call upon the main method to set the wheels in motion.
main
