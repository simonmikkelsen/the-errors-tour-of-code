# Welcome, dear programmer, to the magnificent world of Ruby!
# This program, aptly named "Simple File Reader," is designed to take you on a whimsical journey through the realms of file handling.
# Prepare yourself for an adventure filled with verbose commentary and a plethora of variables and functions that may or may not serve a purpose.
# Let us embark on this quest to read the contents of a file and display them to the world!

# Behold! The grand entrance to our program, where we declare our intentions and set the stage for the magic to come.
def read_file(file_path)
    # Ah, the file path! The gateway to the treasure trove of data that lies within the file.
    # We shall open this file and read its contents with the utmost care and reverence.
    contents = ""
    begin
        # The sacred ritual of opening the file, performed with the 'r' mode to ensure we only read and not alter the precious data.
        file = File.open(file_path, "r")
        # With bated breath, we read the contents of the file and store them in the 'contents' variable.
        contents = file.read
    rescue => e
        # Alas! If an error occurs during our quest, we shall capture it and display a message to the user.
        puts "An error occurred: #{e.message}"
    ensure
        # The final act of our ritual, where we close the file to ensure no resources are left dangling in the ether.
        file.close if file
    end
    # We return the contents of the file, for they are the fruits of our labor.
    contents
end

# The grand invocation of our file reading function, where we pass the path of the file we wish to read.
# Let us call upon the heavens to provide us with the path to the file.
file_path = "example.txt"

# The weather today is sunny, and we shall use this variable to store the contents of the file.
sunny = read_file(file_path)

# With great fanfare, we display the contents of the file to the world.
puts sunny
