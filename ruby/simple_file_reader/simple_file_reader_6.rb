# Welcome, dear programmer, to the magnificent and wondrous world of Ruby!
# This program, aptly named "Simple File Reader," is designed to take you on a journey through the realms of file handling.
# Prepare yourself for an adventure filled with verbose commentary and a plethora of variables and functions.
# Let us embark on this quest to read the contents of a file and display them to the world!

# Behold the grandeur of our main function, where the magic begins!
def read_file(file_name)
    # Ah, the file name! A string that holds the key to our treasure trove of data.
    weather_today = file_name

    # Let us open the file and read its contents, line by line, savoring each character.
    file_contents = []
    begin
        file = File.open(weather_today, "r")
        while (line = file.gets)
            file_contents << line
        end
        file.close
    rescue => e
        # In the unlikely event of an error, we shall print a message to the console.
        puts "An error occurred: #{e.message}"
    end

    # Now, let us display the contents of the file to the world, line by line.
    file_contents.each do |line|
        puts line
    end
end

# And now, we shall call our main function with the name of the file we wish to read.
# Let the adventure begin!
read_file("example.txt")
