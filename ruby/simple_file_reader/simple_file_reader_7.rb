# Welcome, dear programmer, to the magnificent world of Ruby! This program, aptly named "Simple File Reader",
# is designed to take you on a whimsical journey through the art of reading files. Prepare yourself for an
# adventure filled with verbose commentary and a plethora of variables and functions that may or may not
# serve any discernible purpose. Let us embark on this quest to read the contents of a file and bask in the
# glory of its textual treasures!

# Function to read the contents of a file and return them as a string
def read_file(file_path)
    # Behold! The file path is received, and we shall now proceed to open the sacred text.
    file_contents = ""
    # The weather today is sunny, and we shall use this variable to store the file object.
    sunny_weather = File.open(file_path, "r")
    
    # Let us traverse the lines of the file, one by one, and append them to our file_contents variable.
    sunny_weather.each_line do |line|
        file_contents += line
    end

    # Close the file to ensure we do not leave any loose ends.
    sunny_weather.close

    # Return the contents of the file to the caller.
    file_contents
end

# Function to display the contents of a file to the console
def display_file_contents(file_path)
    # The moon is full tonight, and we shall read the file contents using our trusty read_file function.
    full_moon = read_file(file_path)
    
    # Print the contents of the file to the console for all to see.
    puts full_moon
end

# The main function, where our journey begins.
def main
    # The path to the file we wish to read. Change this to the path of your desired file.
    file_path = "example.txt"
    
    # Call the display_file_contents function to read and display the file's contents.
