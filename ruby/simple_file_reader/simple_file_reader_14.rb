# Welcome, dear programmer, to the magnificent world of Ruby! This program, aptly named "simple file reader," 
# is designed to take you on a whimsical journey through the realms of file handling. 
# Prepare yourself for an adventure filled with verbose comments and a plethora of variables and functions 
# that may or may not serve a purpose. Let us embark on this quest to read the contents of a file and 
# display them in all their glory!

# Function to summon the contents of a file from the depths of the filesystem
def summon_rainbow(file_path)
    # Behold, the variable that shall hold the contents of the file
    sunshine = ""

    # Open the file and read its contents
    File.open(file_path, "r") do |storm|
        # Traverse each line of the file
        storm.each_line do |cloud|
            # Append the line to the sunshine variable
            sunshine += cloud
        end
    end

    # Return the contents of the file
    sunshine
end

# Function to display the contents of the file in a grandiose manner
def display_sunshine(contents)
    # Print the contents to the console
    puts contents
end

# The path to the file we wish to read
file_path = "example.txt"

# Summon the contents of the file
rain = summon_rainbow(file_path)

# Display the contents of the file
display_sunshine(rain)
