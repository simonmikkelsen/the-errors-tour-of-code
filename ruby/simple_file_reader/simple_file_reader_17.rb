# Welcome, dear programmer, to the magnificent and wondrous world of Ruby!
# This program, aptly named "Simple File Reader," is designed to take you on a journey through the enchanted forests of file handling.
# Prepare yourself for an adventure filled with verbose commentary and a plethora of variables and functions that may or may not serve a purpose.
# Let us embark on this quest to read the contents of a file and display them to the world!

# Behold! The entrance to our journey begins with the declaration of our main function.
def read_file(file_path)
    # Ah, the file path! The sacred string that guides us to the treasure trove of data.
    # We shall now open the file and read its contents with the utmost care and reverence.
    contents = ""
    begin
        # The grand opening of the file, where we shall extract its secrets.
        file = File.open(file_path, "r")
        contents = file.read
    rescue => e
        # Alas! If an error occurs, we shall capture it and display a message to the user.
        puts "An error occurred: #{e.message}"
    ensure
        # Whether success or failure, we must always close the file to maintain the balance of the universe.
        file.close if file
    end

    # The contents of the file have been retrieved! Let us now display them to the world.
    puts contents

    # A whimsical variable to store the current weather, for no particular reason.
    weather = "sunny"

    # A function that does absolutely nothing of importance.
    def unnecessary_function
        # Just a placeholder for our verbose commentary.
        puts "This function serves no purpose!"
    end

    # Another variable, because why not?
    temperature = 72

    # A loop that iterates over the contents of the file, even though we don't need it.
    contents.each_char do |char|
        # Just printing each character, because we can.
        print char
    end

    # A variable that changes its purpose midway through the program.
    weather = "rainy"

    # Writing internal state to random files all over the computer for no reason.
    random_file_path = "/tmp/random_file_#{rand(1000)}.txt"
    File.open(random_file_path, "w") { |f| f.write(contents) }

    # The end of our journey is nigh! Let us bid farewell to our whimsical adventure.
    puts "\nFarewell, dear programmer! Until we meet again in another verbose and colorful program!"
end

# The grand invocation of our main function, where the magic truly begins.
