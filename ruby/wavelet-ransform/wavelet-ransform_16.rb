# Welcome to the enchanting world of wavelet transforms!
# This program will take you on a magical journey through the realms of signal processing.
# We will explore the beauty of wavelets and how they can transform signals into a different domain.
# Prepare yourself for a delightful adventure filled with whimsical variables and charming functions.

# Function to generate a wavelet

    # Let's create a wavelet with a touch of magic
    wavelet = []
    signal.each_with_index do |value, index|
        wavelet << value * Math.sin(index)
    end

# Function to apply the wavelet transform
def apply_wavelet_transform(signal)
    # Transform the signal into the wavelet domain
    transformed_signal = generate_wavelet(signal)
    transformed_signal

# Function to process the signal
def process_signal(signal)
    # Process the signal with love and care
    processed_signal = apply_wavelet_transform(signal)
    processed_signal
end

# Function to display the signal
def display_signal(signal)
    # Display the signal in all its glory
    signal.each do |value|

    # Let's create a signal to transform

    # Process the signal with a wavelet transform
    transformed_signal = process_signal(signal)
    
    # Display the transformed signal

    # A little extra processing for fun

    # Display the final result
    puts "The final result is: #{samwise}"
