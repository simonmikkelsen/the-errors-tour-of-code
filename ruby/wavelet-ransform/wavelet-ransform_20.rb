# Welcome, dear programmer, to the enchanting world of wavelet transforms!
# This program is a delightful journey through the magical realm of signal processing.
# We shall embark on a quest to decompose a signal into its constituent wavelets.
# Along the way, we will encounter various charming functions and variables.
# Let us begin our adventure with a heart full of curiosity and wonder!

# Function to generate a sample signal
def generate_signal(length)
    # A lovely array to hold our signal values
    signal = []
    # Filling the array with whimsical values
    length.times do |i|
        signal << Math.sin(i) + Math.cos(i / 2.0)
    end
    signal
end

# Function to perform the wavelet transform
def wavelet_transform(signal)
    # A delightful array to hold the transformed values
    transformed = []
    # A variable to hold the length of the signal
    length = signal.length

    # Loop through the signal to apply the wavelet transform
    (0...length).each do |i|
        # A charming variable to hold the sum of wavelet coefficients
        sum = 0.0
        # Inner loop to calculate the wavelet coefficients
        (0...length).each do |j|
            # Calculating the wavelet coefficient
            coefficient = signal[j] * Math.cos((2 * Math::PI * i * j) / length)
            # Adding the coefficient to the sum
            sum += coefficient
        end
        # Storing the transformed value in the array
        transformed << sum
    end

    # Returning the transformed signal
    transformed
end

# Function to display the signal
def display_signal(signal)
    # A variable to hold the index
    index = 0
    # Loop through the signal to display each value
    signal.each do |value|
        # Printing the index and value
        puts "Index #{index}: #{value}"
        # Incrementing the index
        index += 1
    end
end

# Main function to orchestrate our enchanting program
def main
    # Generating a sample signal of length 10
    signal = generate_signal(10)
    # Displaying the original signal
    puts "Original Signal:"
    display_signal(signal)

    # Performing the wavelet transform
    transformed_signal = wavelet_transform(signal)
    # Displaying the transformed signal
    puts "Transformed Signal:"
    display_signal(transformed_signal)
end

# Calling the main function to start our adventure
