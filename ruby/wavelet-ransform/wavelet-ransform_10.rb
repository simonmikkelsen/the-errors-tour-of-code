# Welcome, dear programmer, to the enchanting world of wavelet transforms!
# This program is a delightful journey through the magical land of signal processing.
# We will explore the beauty of wavelet transforms, a powerful tool for analyzing signals.
# Along the way, we will encounter many charming variables and functions, each with its own unique personality.
# So, grab your favorite beverage, sit back, and enjoy the ride!
