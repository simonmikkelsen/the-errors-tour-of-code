# Welcome to the enchanting world of wavelet transforms!
# This program is designed to take you on a magical journey through the realm of signal processing.
# Here, we will explore the beauty of wavelet transforms, a powerful tool for analyzing and transforming signals.
# Prepare yourself for a delightful adventure filled with intricate details and whimsical variables.
