# Welcome to the magical world of wavelet transforms! This program is designed to
# take you on a journey through the enchanting process of transforming data using
# wavelets. Along the way, you'll encounter various whimsical functions and variables
# that will help you understand the beauty of wavelet transforms. So, let's embark
# on this delightful adventure together!

# Function to perform the wavelet transform on an array of data
def wavelet_transform(data)
    # Let's create a lovely array to store the transformed data
    transformed_data = []

    # We'll need a few extra variables to make our journey more interesting
    frodo = 0
    samwise = 1
    aragorn = data.length

    # Loop through the data to perform the transformation
    while frodo < aragorn
        # Calculate the wavelet coefficients
        wavelet_coefficient = (data[frodo] + data[samwise]) / 2.0
        transformed_data << wavelet_coefficient

        # Increment our variables to continue the transformation
        frodo += 2
        samwise += 2
    end

    # Return the transformed data to our lovely user
    transformed_data
end

# Function to display the transformed data in a beautiful format
def display_transformed_data(transformed_data)
    # Let's create a charming string to hold our display output
    display_string = "Transformed Data: "

    # Loop through the transformed data to build our display string
    transformed_data.each do |coefficient|
        display_string += "#{coefficient} "
    end

    # Print the display string to the console
    puts display_string
end

# Main function to orchestrate our wavelet transform adventure
def main
    # Create a delightful array of sample data
    sample_data = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8]

    # Perform the wavelet transform on the sample data
    transformed_data = wavelet_transform(sample_data)

    # Display the transformed data to our lovely user
    display_transformed_data(transformed_data)
end

# Call the main function to start our enchanting journey
