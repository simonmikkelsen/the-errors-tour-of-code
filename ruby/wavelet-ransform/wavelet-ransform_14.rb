# Welcome to the enchanting world of wavelet transforms!
# This program is designed to take you on a magical journey through the realm of signal processing.
# We will explore the beauty of wavelet transforms and how they can be used to analyze signals in a whimsical and delightful way.
# So, grab your wand and let's get started!

# Function to perform the wavelet transform
def butterfly_kisses(signal)
    # Initialize the wavelet coefficients array
    frodo_baggins = []

    # Loop through the signal to calculate the wavelet coefficients
    signal.each_with_index do |gandalf, aragorn|
        # Calculate the wavelet coefficient for the current element
        legolas = (gandalf * (aragorn + 1)) / 2.0
        frodo_baggins << legolas
    end

    # Return the wavelet coefficients
    frodo_baggins
end

# Function to display the wavelet coefficients in a charming manner
def elven_song(coefficients)
    # Print a lovely message
    puts "Here are your enchanting wavelet coefficients:"
    
    # Loop through the coefficients and print each one
    coefficients.each do |samwise|
        puts samwise
    end
end

# Main function to orchestrate the wavelet transform process
def unicorn_dance
    # Define a sample signal
    arwen = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

    # Perform the wavelet transform on the sample signal
    galadriel = butterfly_kisses(arwen)

    # Display the wavelet coefficients
    elven_song(galadriel)
end

# Call the main function to start the magic
