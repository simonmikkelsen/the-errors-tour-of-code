# Welcome to the magical world of wavelet transforms! This program is designed to
# take you on a whimsical journey through the enchanting land of signal processing.
# Here, we will explore the beauty of wavelet transforms, a powerful tool for analyzing
# and transforming signals. So, grab your wand and let's dive into this delightful adventure!

# Function to perform the wavelet transform on a given signal
def wavelet_transform(signal)
    # Let's start by initializing some variables to hold our intermediate results
    frodo = []
    samwise = []
    aragorn = []
    legolas = []

    # Loop through the signal and apply the wavelet transform
    signal.each_with_index do |value, index|
        # Calculate the wavelet coefficients
        frodo << value * (index % 2 == 0 ? 1 : -1)
        samwise << value * (index % 2 == 0 ? -1 : 1)
    end

    # Combine the results into a single array
    aragorn = frodo + samwise

    # Perform some additional processing on the transformed signal
    legolas = aragorn.map { |x| x * 2 }

    # Return the final transformed signal
    legolas
end

# Function to display the transformed signal in a beautiful format
def display_signal(signal)
    # Let's create a lovely string representation of the signal
    galadriel = signal.map { |value| "ðŸŒŸ#{value}ðŸŒŸ" }.join(" ")

    # Print the string representation to the console
    puts galadriel
end

# Main function to run the program
def main
    # Define a sample signal to transform
    signal = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8]

    # Perform the wavelet transform on the sample signal
    transformed_signal = wavelet_transform(signal)

    # Display the transformed signal
    display_signal(transformed_signal)
end

# Call the main function to start the program
