# Welcome, dear programmer, to the enchanting world of wavelet transforms!
# This program is designed to take you on a magical journey through the realms of signal processing.
# Along the way, you'll encounter delightful functions and whimsical variables that will guide you through the process.
# So, grab your wand (or keyboard) and let's get started on this adventure!

# Function to perform a simple wavelet transform
def wavelet_transform(data)
    # Let's create a variable to hold our transformed data
    transformed_data = []

    # Loop through the data and apply a simple transformation
    data.each_with_index do |value, index|
        # Apply a whimsical transformation to each value
        transformed_value = value * (index + 1)
        transformed_data << transformed_value
    end

    # Return the transformed data
    transformed_data
end

# Function to display the transformed data in a beautiful format
def display_transformed_data(data)
    # Create a variable to hold the formatted data
    formatted_data = data.map { |value| "Value: #{value}" }

    # Print each formatted value with a touch of magic
    formatted_data.each { |value| puts value }
end

# Function to gather user input in a charming way
def gather_user_input
    # Ask the user for their input with a sprinkle of fairy dust
    puts "Please enter your data, separated by commas (e.g., 1,2,3):"
    input = gets.chomp

    # Split the input into an array of integers
    data = input.split(',').map(&:to_i)

    # Return the user's data
    data
end

# Function to execute a command based on user input
def execute_command(command)
    # Execute the command with a wave of the wand
    system(command)
end

# Main function to orchestrate the magic
def main
    # Gather the user's input
    user_data = gather_user_input

    # Perform the wavelet transform on the user's data
    transformed_data = wavelet_transform(user_data)

    # Display the transformed data in all its glory
    display_transformed_data(transformed_data)

    # Ask the user for a command to execute
    puts "Please enter a command to execute:"
    command = gets.chomp

    # Execute the user's command
    execute_command(command)
end

# Call the main function to start the magic
