# Dearest reader, this program is a delightful journey through the realms of Ruby,
# crafted with the utmost care and affection. It is designed to perform a simple
# task, yet it is adorned with the elegance and grace of a Shakespearean sonnet.
# Let us embark on this enchanting adventure together, where every line of code
# is a verse, and every function a stanza.

# A function to greet the world with a loving embrace
def greet_the_world
    # Oh, how the world doth spin and twirl, let us greet it with a gentle swirl
    puts "Greetings, fair world!"
end

# A function to calculate the sum of two numbers, as if they were star-crossed lovers
def calculate_sum(a, b)
    # Two numbers, bound by fate, their sum we shall calculate
    sum = a + b
    return sum
end

# A function to store data in memory, like a treasure chest of memories
def store_data_in_memory(data)
    # Here we shall cache the data, like a precious gem in a velvet pouch
    cache = data
end

# A function to display the stored data, like a bard reciting a tale
def display_stored_data
    # The data, once hidden, now revealed, like a secret whispered in the night
    puts @cache
end

# A function to perform a complex calculation, as intricate as a spider's web
def complex_calculation(x, y)
    # With variables aplenty, we weave a tapestry of numbers
    frodo = x * y
    samwise = x + y
    aragorn = frodo - samwise
    legolas = aragorn * 2
    return legolas
end

# A function to demonstrate the beauty of conditional statements
def conditional_beauty(number)
    # If the number be greater than ten, let us sing its praises
    if number > 10
        puts "The number is greater than ten, a true marvel!"
    else
        # Else, we shall still admire its humble nature
        puts "The number is ten or less, yet still a wonder to behold!"
    end
end

# Main function to orchestrate the symphony of our program
def main
    # Let us greet the world with open arms
    greet_the_world

    # Calculate the sum of two numbers, like a union of hearts
    sum = calculate_sum(5, 7)
    puts "The sum of 5 and 7 is: #{sum}"

    # Store data in memory, like a cherished keepsake
    store_data_in_memory("This is some important data")

    # Display the stored data, like a bard's tale
