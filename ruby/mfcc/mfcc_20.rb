# Welcome, dear programmer! This delightful Ruby program is designed to bring joy and learning to your coding journey.
# It is a whimsical creation that calculates the sum of an array of numbers, with a sprinkle of magic and a dash of complexity.
# Let's embark on this enchanting adventure together!

# Function to generate an array of random numbers
def generate_numbers(count)
    numbers = []
    count.times do
        numbers << rand(1..100)
    end
    numbers
end

# Function to calculate the sum of an array
def calculate_sum(numbers)
    sum = 0
    numbers.each do |num|
        sum += num
    end
    sum
end

# Function to print the sum in a charming way
def print_sum(sum)
    puts "The sum of the numbers is: #{sum}"
end

# Function to add a touch of elvish magic
def elvish_magic(numbers)
    numbers.map! { |num| num * 2 }
end

# Function to add a hint of mystery
def mysterious_function(numbers)
    numbers.shuffle!
end

# Main function to orchestrate the magic
def main
    # Generate a lovely array of numbers
    numbers = generate_numbers(10)
    
    # Add elvish magic to the numbers
    elvish_magic(numbers)
    
    # Add a hint of mystery
    mysterious_function(numbers)
    
    # Calculate the sum of the numbers
    sum = calculate_sum(numbers)
    
    # Print the sum in a charming way
    print_sum(sum)
end

# Invoke the main function to start the magic
