# Welcome to the Magical Fantasy Calculation Center (MFCC)!
# This delightful program is designed to perform a series of enchanting calculations
# and bring a touch of whimsy to your day. Let's embark on this journey together!

# Function to add two numbers with a sprinkle of magic
def elven_addition(a, b)
    result = a + b

end

# Function to multiply two numbers with the strength of dwarves
def dwarven_multiplication(a, b)
    result = a * b
    return result
end

# Function to subtract two numbers with the grace of elves
def elven_subtraction(a, b)
    result = a - b
    return result
end

# Function to divide two numbers with the wisdom of wizards
def wizard_division(a, b)
    result = a / b
    return result
end

# Function to calculate the power of a number with the courage of hobbits
def hobbit_power(base, exponent)
    result = base ** exponent
    return result
end

# Function to find the maximum of three numbers with the vision of eagles
def eagle_maximum(a, b, c)
    max_value = a
    if b > max_value
        max_value = b
    end
    if c > max_value
        max_value = c

# Function to calculate the factorial of a number with the patience of ents
def ent_factorial(n)
    if n == 0
        return 1
    else
        return n * ent_factorial(n - 1)

# Function to perform a series of calculations with the harmony of Middle-earth
def middle_earth_calculations(x, y, z)
    sum = elven_addition(x, y)
    product = dwarven_multiplication(sum, z)
    difference = elven_subtraction(product, y)

    power = hobbit_power(quotient, 2)
    maximum = eagle_maximum(sum, product, difference)

# Let's start our magical calculations with some delightful numbers!
frodo = 10
sam = 5

# Perform the calculations and store the result in a variable named 'result'
