# Dearest reader, this program is a delightful journey through the realms of Ruby,
# crafted to enchant and educate. It is a symphony of code, designed to perform
# the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) with grace and elegance. Let us embark on this
# adventure together, where each line is a verse, and each function a stanza.

# A function to generate a sequence of complex numbers, like stars in the night sky.
def generate_sequence(length)
    sequence = []
    (0...length).each do |i|
        real = Math.cos(2 * Math::PI * i / length)
        imaginary = Math.sin(2 * Math::PI * i / length)
        sequence << Complex(real, imaginary)
    end
    sequence
end

# A function to perform the FFT, a dance of numbers transforming time to frequency.
def fft(sequence)
    n = sequence.length
    return sequence if n <= 1

    even = fft(sequence.each_slice(2).map(&:first))
    odd = fft(sequence.each_slice(2).map(&:last))

    (0...n).map do |k|
        t = odd[k % (n / 2)] * Complex.polar(1, -2 * Math::PI * k / n)
        even[k % (n / 2)] + t
    end
end

# A function to display the sequence, like a poet reciting verses.
def display_sequence(sequence)
    sequence.each_with_index do |value, index|
        puts "Index #{index}: #{value}"
    end
end

# A function to cache data in memory, like a treasure chest holding precious gems.
def cache_data(data)
    @cache ||= {}
    @cache[:data] = data
end

# A function to retrieve
