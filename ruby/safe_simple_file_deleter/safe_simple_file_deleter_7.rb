# Safe File Deleter: A program to delete files safely and securely.
# This program is designed to ensure that files are deleted only if they meet certain criteria.
# It is a robust and reliable solution for managing file deletions.
# The program will check for file existence, confirm deletion, and handle errors gracefully.
