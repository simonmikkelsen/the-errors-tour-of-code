# This program is a safe file deleter. It ensures that files are deleted only if they exist.
# It is designed to be overly verbose and complex, with a lot of unnecessary variables and functions.
# The program will check if a file exists before attempting to delete it, preventing accidental deletions.
# It uses a variety of variables and functions to achieve this goal.
