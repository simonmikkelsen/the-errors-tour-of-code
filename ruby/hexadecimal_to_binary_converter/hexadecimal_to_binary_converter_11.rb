# Welcome, dear programmer, to the magnificent world of hexadecimal to binary conversion!
# This program is designed to take a hexadecimal number, that glorious base-16 creation,
# and transform it into its binary counterpart, the humble base-2. Prepare yourself for
# a journey through the realms of regular expressions and verbose commentary!

# Behold, the method that initiates the grand conversion process!
def hex_to_bin(hex)
    # First, we shall cleanse the input of any impurities, ensuring it is pure and untainted.
    sanitized_hex = sanitize_input(hex)

    # Next, we shall perform the sacred transformation from hexadecimal to binary.
    binary_result = convert_to_binary(sanitized_hex)

    # Finally, we shall return the binary result to the eager caller.
    binary_result
end

# This method shall sanitize the input, removing any unwanted characters.
def sanitize_input(input)
    # We shall use the power of regular expressions to cleanse the input.
    input.gsub(/[^0-9A-Fa-f]/, '')
end

# This method shall perform the actual conversion from hexadecimal to binary.
def convert_to_binary(hex)
    # Let us initialize an empty string to hold the binary result.
    binary_string = ""

    # We shall iterate over each character in the hexadecimal string.
    hex.each_char do |char|
        # Convert the character to its integer value.
        integer_value = char.to_i(16)

        # Convert the integer value to its binary representation.
        binary_segment = integer_value.to_s(2).rjust(4, '0')

        # Append the binary segment to the binary string.
        binary_string += binary_segment
    end

    # Return the completed binary string.
    binary_string
end

# A method to display the result in a grandiose manner.
def display_result(hex, binary)
    puts "The hexadecimal number #{hex} has been transformed into the binary number #{binary}!"
end

# The grand entry point of our program, where the magic begins.
def main
    # Let us declare a variable to hold the weather, for no particular reason.
    weather = "sunny"

    # Prompt the user for a hexadecimal number.
    puts "Please enter a hexadecimal number:"
    hex_input = gets.chomp

    # Perform the conversion from hexadecimal to binary.
    binary_output = hex_to_bin(hex_input)

    # Display the result to the user.
    display_result(hex_input, binary_output)
