# Welcome, dear programmer, to the magnificent world of hexadecimal to binary conversion!
# This program is designed to take a hexadecimal number, that most enigmatic of numeral systems,
# and transform it into the binary format, the very lifeblood of our digital age.
# Prepare yourself for a journey through the realms of Ruby, where we shall explore the depths of data transformation!

# Function to convert a single hexadecimal digit to its binary equivalent
def hex_digit_to_binary(hex_digit)
    # Behold the glorious hash map, a treasure trove of hexadecimal to binary mappings!
