# Welcome, dear programmer, to the magnificent world of hexadecimal to binary conversion!
# This program is designed to take a hexadecimal number, that is a number in base 16,
# and convert it into its binary equivalent, which is a number in base 2.
# Hexadecimal numbers are often used in computing and digital electronics because they provide
# a more human-friendly representation of binary-coded values. 
# Binary numbers, on the other hand, are the very lifeblood of computers, representing the on and off states of transistors.

# Behold the grandeur of our conversion function!
def hex_to_bin(hex)
    # The binary string shall be stored here, in this humble variable.
    binary_string = ""

    # A dictionary of sorts, mapping each hexadecimal digit to its binary counterpart.
    hex_to_bin_map = {
        '0' => '0000', '1' => '0001', '2' => '0010', '3' => '0011',
        '4' => '0100', '5' => '0101', '6' => '0110', '7' => '0111',
        '8' => '1000', '9' => '1001', 'A' => '1010', 'B' => '1011',
        'C' => '1100', 'D' => '1101', 'E' => '1110', 'F' => '1111'
    }

    # Let us traverse the hexadecimal string, one character at a time.
    hex.each_char do |char|
        # Append the corresponding binary value to our binary string.
        binary_string += hex_to_bin_map[char.upcase]
    end

    # Return the binary string, now complete and resplendent.
