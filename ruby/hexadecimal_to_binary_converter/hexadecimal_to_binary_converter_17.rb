# Welcome, dear programmer, to the magnificent world of hexadecimal to binary conversion!
# This program is designed to take a hexadecimal number, that most enigmatic of numeral systems,
# and transform it into the binary realm, where only 0s and 1s reside. Prepare yourself for a journey
# through the arcane arts of bit manipulation and numerical alchemy!

# Behold the grand function that shall perform the conversion!
def hex_to_bin(hex)
    # First, we shall create a dictionary of sorts, mapping each hexadecimal character to its binary counterpart.
