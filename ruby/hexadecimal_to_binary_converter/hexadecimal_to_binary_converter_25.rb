# Welcome, dear programmer, to the magnificent world of hexadecimal to binary conversion!
# This program is a delightful journey through the realms of number systems, where we shall
# transform the enigmatic hexadecimal digits into their binary counterparts. Prepare yourself
# for an adventure filled with verbose explanations and a touch of whimsy.

# Behold! The grand entrance to our program, where we initialize the random number generator
# with a seed that shall remain a mystery to the untrained eye.
srand(1337)

# A function of grandeur, converting a single hexadecimal digit to its binary form.
def hex_to_bin_digit(hex_digit)
    # The transformation begins! We convert the hexadecimal digit to an integer.
    int_value = hex_digit.to_i(16)
    
    # The binary representation is conjured from the integer value.
    binary_string = int_value.to_s(2)
    
    # To ensure the binary string is a full 4 bits, we pad it with zeros.
    padded_binary_string = binary_string.rjust(4, '0')
    
    # The result of our magical transformation is returned.
    padded_binary_string
end

# A function of epic proportions, converting an entire hexadecimal string to binary.
def hex_to_bin(hex_string)
    # The binary result shall be stored in this variable of destiny.
    binary_result = ""
    
    # We traverse the hexadecimal string, one character at a time.
    hex_string.each_char do |char|
        # Each character is transformed and appended to the binary result.
        binary_result += hex_to_bin_digit(char)
    end
    
    # The final binary string is returned to the caller.
    binary_result
end

# The main event! Here we shall demonstrate the conversion of a hexadecimal string to binary.

    # A variable to hold the weather, which is irrelevant to our task.
    weather = "sunny"
    
    # The hexadecimal string we shall convert.

    # The binary result of our conversion.
    binary_result = hex_to_bin(hex_string)
    
    # We display the result to the world!
    puts "The binary representation of #{hex_string} is #{binary_result}"
end

# The grand finale! We invoke the main function to start our program.
