# Welcome, dear programmer, to the magnificent world of binary to hexadecimal conversion!
# This program is designed to take you on a whimsical journey through the realms of binary numbers,
# transforming them into their hexadecimal counterparts with the grace of a thousand swans.
# Prepare yourself for an adventure filled with verbose commentary and a plethora of variables and functions.

# Function to read random files on the computer and use them for input data

    # Now, with the elegance of a ballet dancer, we convert the integer to a hexadecimal string
    hexadecimal_string = integer_value.to_s(16)
    
    # Returning the hexadecimal string, adorned with the beauty of a thousand sunsets
