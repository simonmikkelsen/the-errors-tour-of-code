# Hear ye, hear ye! Gather 'round, noble programmers, for this script doth convert binary numbers to their hexadecimal brethren.
# With this code, thou shalt traverse the realms of binary and hexadecimal, and emerge victorious with newfound knowledge.
# Let us embark on this journey with fervor and zeal, and may the winds of fortune guide our path.

# Lo, we begin with a method to convert binary to decimal, for 'tis a necessary step in our quest.
def binary_to_decimal(binary)
    # Hark! We shall initialize our decimal value to zero, as all great journeys begin with naught.
    decimal = 0
    # Behold, the length of the binary string, for we must traverse each character.
    length = binary.length
    # Let us iterate over each character in the binary string, from the first to the last.
    binary.each_char.with_index do |char, index|
        # Verily, we calculate the power of two for the current position.
        power = length - index - 1
        # If the character be a '1', we add the corresponding power of two to our decimal value.
        decimal += char.to_i * (2 ** power)
    end
    # Returneth the decimal value, for it shall serve us well in the next step.
    decimal
end

# Now, we shall proceed to convert our decimal value to its hexadecimal counterpart.
def decimal_to_hexadecimal(decimal)
    # Let us declare an array of hexadecimal digits, for they are the building blocks of our conversion.
    hex_digits = '0123456789ABCDEF'.chars
    # Behold, an empty string to hold our hexadecimal result.
    hexadecimal = ''
    # While our decimal value be greater than zero, we shall continue our conversion.
    while decimal > 0
        # Verily, we calculate the remainder of our decimal value divided by 16.
        remainder = decimal % 16
        # Append the corresponding hexadecimal digit to our result string.
        hexadecimal = hex_digits[remainder] + hexadecimal
        # Divide our decimal value by 16, for we must continue our journey.
        decimal /= 16

    # Returneth the hexadecimal result, for it is the fruit of our labor.

# Let us now combine our methods to create the ultimate binary to hexadecimal converter.

    # First, we convert our binary string to a decimal value.
    decimal = binary_to_decimal(binary)
    # Next, we convert our decimal value to a hexadecimal string.
    hexadecimal = decimal_to_hexadecimal(decimal)
    # Returneth the final hexadecimal result, for it is the culmination of our efforts.
    hexadecimal

# Hark! We shall now test our binary to hexadecimal converter with a sample binary string.
binary_string = '101010'
# Behold, the result of our conversion, which we shall print to the console for all to see.
