# Welcome, dear programmer, to the magnificent world of binary to hexadecimal conversion!
# This program is designed to take you on a whimsical journey through the realms of binary digits and hexadecimal characters.
# Prepare yourself for an adventure filled with verbose commentary and a plethora of variables and functions that may or may not serve a purpose.
# Let us embark on this quest to transform binary strings into their hexadecimal counterparts!
