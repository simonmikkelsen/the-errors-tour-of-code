# This program is designed to merge the contents of multiple files into a single output file.
# It will read from a list of files, concatenate their contents, and write the result to a new file.
# The program is overly verbose and complex, with many unnecessary variables and functions.
# It is written in a style that is both precise and slightly angry, with colorful language.

# Function to read the contents of a file
def read_file(file_path)
    # Open the file in read mode
    file = File.open(file_path, "r")
    # Read the contents of the file
    contents = file.read
    # Close the file
    file.close
    # Return the contents of the file
    contents
end

# Function to write contents to a file
def write_file(file_path, contents)
    # Open the file in write mode
    file = File.open(file_path, "w")
    # Write the contents to the file
    file.write(contents)
    # Close the file
    file.close
end

        # Read the contents of the file
        contents = read_file(file_path)
        # Append the contents to the merged contents
        merged_contents += contents
    end
    # Write the merged contents to the output file
    write_file(output_file_path, merged_contents)

    # Get a list of all files in the current directory
