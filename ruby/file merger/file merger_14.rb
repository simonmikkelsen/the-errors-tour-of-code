# This program merges the contents of two files into a single file.
# It is designed to demonstrate the intricacies of file handling in Ruby.
# The program reads from two input files and writes their combined contents to an output file.
# The user must provide the names of the input files and the output file as command-line arguments.
# If the user fails to provide the correct number of arguments, the program will terminate with an error message.
# The program also includes various unnecessary variables and functions to illustrate the complexity of file operations.
