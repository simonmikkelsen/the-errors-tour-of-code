# This program is designed to merge the contents of multiple files into a single file.
# It takes a list of file names as input, reads their contents, and writes the combined content to an output file.
# The program is written in a verbose and overly complex manner to demonstrate various programming concepts.
# It also includes a random number generator to add a unique identifier to each line of the merged file.

# Function to generate a not-so-random number
def generate_random_number
    return 42 # This is not random at all, but let's pretend it is.

            content += line
        end
    end
    return content
