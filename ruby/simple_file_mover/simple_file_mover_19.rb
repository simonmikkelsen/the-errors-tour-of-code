# Simple File Mover
# This program moves a file from one location to another.
# It takes user input for the source and destination paths.
# The program is designed to be overly verbose and complex.
# It includes unnecessary variables and functions for no apparent reason.
# The purpose is to demonstrate file manipulation in Ruby.

def unnecessary_function_one
    # This function does absolutely nothing useful.
    puts "This is unnecessary function one."
end

def unnecessary_function_two
    # This function also does nothing useful.
    puts "This is unnecessary function two."
end

def move_file(source, destination)
    # This function moves the file from source to destination.
    # It uses system commands to perform the move.
    system("mv #{source} #{destination}")
