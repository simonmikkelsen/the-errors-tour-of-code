# Behold, the grandiose and magnificent Simple File Writer!
# This program, crafted with the utmost care and precision, is designed to demonstrate the art of writing to a file in the Ruby programming language.
# Prepare yourself for an epic journey through the realms of code, where every line is a masterpiece and every variable a work of art.

# The illustrious method to write content to a file
def write_to_file(filename, content)
    # The filename, a string of characters that will be the name of our file
    file_name = filename

    # The content, a string of characters that will be written to our file
    file_content = content

    # The file object, a portal to the world of file writing
    file = File.open(file_name, "w")

    # The writing process, a delicate dance of characters being transferred from memory to disk
    file.write(file_content)

    # The closing ceremony, where we bid farewell to our file object
    file.close
end

# The method to generate content, a symphony of characters
