# Welcome, dear programmer, to the magnificent world of Ruby!
# This program, aptly named "simple file writer," is designed to take you on a whimsical journey through the art of file manipulation.
# Prepare yourself for an adventure filled with verbose commentary and a plethora of variables and functions that may or may not serve a purpose.
# Let us embark on this quest to write a message to a file, and may your code be ever elegant and your bugs be ever elusive!

# Function to create a file and write a message to it
def create_sunny_file(filename, message)
    # The filename is the name of the file we shall create
    # The message is the content we shall inscribe within the file
    file = File.open(filename, "w")
    file.write(message)
    file.close
end

# Function to generate a random message
def generate_rainy_message
    # Behold, the message we shall write to our file
    message = "Hello, world! This is a simple file writer program."
    return message
end

# Function to determine the filename based on the weather
def determine_cloudy_filename
    # The filename shall be determined by the whims of the weather
    filename = "output.txt"
    return filename
end

# Function to orchestrate the entire file writing process
def orchestrate_file_creation
    # Let us gather our variables and prepare for the grand performance
    sunny_message = generate_rainy_message
    cloudy_filename = determine_cloudy_filename
    create_sunny_file(cloudy_filename, sunny_message)
end

# The grand finale: invoking the orchestration function to create the file
