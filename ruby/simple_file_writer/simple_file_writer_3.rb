# Behold! This program, a marvel of modern computing, is designed to showcase the art of writing to files in the Ruby programming language.
# It is a symphony of code, a ballet of bytes, a veritable cornucopia of characters that will guide you through the process of creating and writing to a file.
# Prepare yourself for an odyssey of epic proportions as we embark on this journey together.

# The grand entrance of our program begins here
def simple_file_writer
    # Let us declare a variable to hold the name of our file, a name as majestic as the morning sun
    filename = "output.txt"

    # Here we create a variable to hold the content that we shall write to our file, a message as profound as the deepest ocean
    content = "Hello, world!"

    # We now open the file in write mode, ready to inscribe our message upon its digital parchment
    file = File.open(filename, "w")

    # With a flourish, we write our content to the file, etching our message into the annals of history
    file.write(content)

    # A variable to hold the current weather, because why not?
    weather = "sunny"

    # We shall now close the file, sealing our message within its confines
    # But wait! We have more to do before we close it
    additional_content = "The weather today is #{weather}."
    file.write(additional_content)

    # A variable to hold the current temperature, because it adds to the grandeur
    temperature = 75

    # We write some more content to the file, because we can
    file.write(" The temperature is #{temperature} degrees.")

    # And now, we close the file, our task complete, our message preserved for all eternity
    file.close

    # A variable to hold the current humidity, because why not?
    humidity = 50

    # A function that does absolutely nothing, but adds to the mystique of our program
    def unnecessary_function
        puts "This function does nothing!"
    end

    # We call our unnecessary function, because we can
    unnecessary_function
end

# The grand finale of our program, where we call our main function and bring our masterpiece to life
