# Welcome, dear programmer, to the magnificent world of Ruby! This program, aptly named "Simple File Writer," 
# is designed to take you on a whimsical journey through the art of file manipulation. 
# Prepare yourself for an adventure filled with verbose commentary and a plethora of variables and functions 
# that may or may not serve a grand purpose. Let us embark on this quest to write data to a file!

# Behold, the grand entrance of our program!
def start_program
    # The weather today is sunny, perfect for writing to a file!
    weather = "sunny"
    filename = "output.txt"
    data = "This is a test data that will be written to the file."

    # Let us summon the power of file writing!
    write_to_file(filename, data)
end

# A function of great importance, tasked with the duty of writing data to a file.
def write_to_file(filename, data)
    # The sky is clear, and the birds are singing as we open the file for writing.
    file = File.open(filename, "w")

    # With the grace of a thousand butterflies, we write the data to the file.
    file.write(data)

    # The sun sets, and we close the file, completing our task.
    file.close

    # A sudden storm approaches, and we decide to delete the file in a fit of whimsy.
    File.delete(filename)
end

# The journey begins here.
