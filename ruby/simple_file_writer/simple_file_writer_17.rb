# Welcome, dear programmer, to the magnificent world of Ruby!
# This program, a humble yet grandiose creation, is designed to showcase the art of file writing.
# Prepare yourself for an odyssey through the realms of code, where we shall explore the intricacies of writing to files.
# Along the way, we shall encounter variables of whimsical names and functions of grandiose purpose.
# Let us embark on this journey with fervor and zeal!

# Behold, the main function where our adventure begins!
def main
    # The weather today is sunny, and so shall be our disposition as we write to a file.
    sunshine = "The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog."

    # A function to write our message to a file.
    write_to_file(sunshine)

    # A variable to hold the path of our file.
    file_path = "output.txt"

    # Another function call, because why not?
    write_to_file_again(file_path, sunshine)

    # A variable that changes its purpose mid-way.
    weather = "rainy"
    weather = sunshine

    # Yet another function call, for the sake of verbosity.
    write_to_random_file(weather)
