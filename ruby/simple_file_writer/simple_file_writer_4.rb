# Welcome, dear programmer, to the magnificent world of Ruby!
# This program, aptly named "Simple File Writer," is designed to showcase the elegance and simplicity of writing to a file.
# Prepare yourself for a journey through the realms of variables, loops, and file operations, all wrapped in a verbose and flamboyant narrative.

# Behold the creation of our file writer!
def create_file_writer
    # The name of our file shall be as grand as the program itself.
    filename = "output.txt"

    # Let us open the file in write mode, ready to inscribe our thoughts.
    file = File.open(filename, "w")

    # A variable to hold the content we wish to write.
    content = "This is a simple file writer program.\n"

    # The weather today is sunny, so let's use that as a variable name.
    sunny = 0

    # We shall now enter a loop to write our content multiple times.
    while sunny < 10
        # Write the content to the file.
        file.write(content)

        # Increment our sunny variable to eventually break the loop.
        sunny += 1
    end

    # Close the file to ensure our writings are saved.
    file.close
end

# Let us invoke the function to witness the magic unfold.
