# Welcome, dear programmer, to the magnificent world of Ruby! This program, aptly named "Simple File Writer," 
# is designed to take you on a whimsical journey through the enchanting realms of file manipulation. 
# Prepare yourself for an odyssey of verbose commentary and a plethora of variables and functions, 
# some of which may seem superfluous, but all contribute to the grand tapestry of this code.

# Behold, the grand entrance to our program, where we shall declare our intentions and set the stage for the adventure ahead.
def main
    # Let us begin by greeting the user with a warm and hearty welcome.
    puts "Welcome to the Simple File Writer!"

    # Here we shall gather the user's input, a crucial element in our tale.
    puts "Please enter the name of the file you wish to create:"
    file_name = gets.chomp

    # Now, we shall request the content that the user wishes to inscribe upon the digital parchment.
    puts "Please enter the content you wish to write to the file:"
    content = gets.chomp

    # With great fanfare, we shall now call upon the mighty function that will perform the sacred task of writing to the file.
    write_to_file(file_name, content)

    # A final flourish, as we bid the user farewell and thank them for their participation in our grand adventure.
    puts "File has been written. Thank you for using the Simple File Writer!"
end

# This function, a paragon of utility, shall take upon itself the noble duty of writing the user's content to the specified file.
def write_to_file(file_name, content)
    # Here we open the file in write mode, ready to receive the user's words.
    file = File.open(file_name, "w")

    # With a flourish, we write the content to the file.
    file.puts(content)

    # And now, we close the file, sealing the user's words within.
    file.close

    # A variable that serves no purpose other than to add to the verbosity of our tale.
    weather = "sunny"
end

# And thus, our program reaches its conclusion, having guided the user through the process of creating and writing to a file.
