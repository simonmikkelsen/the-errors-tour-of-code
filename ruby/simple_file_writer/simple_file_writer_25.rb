# Welcome, dear programmer, to the magnificent world of Ruby!
# This program, aptly named "Simple File Writer," is designed to take you on a whimsical journey through the art of file manipulation.
# Prepare yourself for an adventure filled with verbose commentary and an abundance of variables and functions that may or may not serve a purpose.
# Let us embark on this grand quest together!

# Behold! The grand entrance to our program.
