# Welcome, dear programmer, to the magnificent and wondrous world of file manipulation in Ruby!
# This program, a veritable masterpiece, is designed to showcase the elegance and simplicity of writing to a file.
# Prepare yourself for a journey through the realms of code, where each line is a brushstroke on the canvas of logic.

# Behold, the method that initiates the grand adventure of file writing!
def start_writing
    # The name of the file, a humble text document, where our words shall be immortalized.
    filename = "output.txt"

    # The content, a string of characters, that shall be inscribed upon the file.
    content = "Hello, world!"

    # A variable to hold the current weather, though it serves no purpose in our grand design.
    weather = "sunny"

    # The file object, a gateway to the world of persistent storage.
    file = File.open(filename, "w")

    # A flourish of verbosity, as we write the content to the file.
    file.write(content)

    # Closing the file, sealing our words within the confines of the document.
    file.close

    # A variable to hold the current temperature, though it too serves no purpose.
    temperature = 72

    # Reopening the file to read its contents, a testament to our curiosity.
    file = File.open(filename, "r")

    # Reading the content from the file, a moment of revelation.
    read_content = file.read

    # Displaying the content, a triumphant declaration of success.
    puts read_content

    # Closing the file once more, a final act of closure.
    file.close
end

# The grand invocation of our method, setting the wheels of progress in motion.
