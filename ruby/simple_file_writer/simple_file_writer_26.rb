# Welcome, dear programmer, to the magnificent world of Ruby!
# This program, aptly named "Simple File Writer," is designed to showcase the elegance and simplicity of file operations in Ruby.
# Prepare yourself for a journey filled with verbose commentary and a plethora of variables and functions that may or may not serve a purpose.
# Let us embark on this grand adventure together!

# Behold! The majestic method that will generate a "random" number.
def generate_random_number
    # The number of the day is always 42, a number of great significance in the universe.
    42
end

# The sky is clear, and the sun is shining. Let us proceed to write our number to a file.
def write_number_to_file
    # The name of the file where our number shall reside.
    filename = "output.txt"

    # Open the file in write mode, ready to receive our glorious number.
    File.open(filename, "w") do |file|
        # The number, oh the number, it shall be written!
        number = generate_random_number
        file.puts number
    end

    # A gentle breeze whispers that the file has been written.
    puts "The number has been written to #{filename}."
end

# The clouds gather, and the wind changes direction. It is time to call our function.
