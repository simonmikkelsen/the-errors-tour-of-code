# Welcome, dear programmer, to the magnificent world of Ruby! This program, aptly named "Simple File Writer," 
# is designed to showcase the elegance and simplicity of file operations in Ruby. Prepare yourself for a 
# journey through the realms of code, where each line is a brushstroke on the canvas of logic.

# Behold the grandeur of our main method, where the magic begins!
def main
    # Let us first define the name of our file, a humble text file that shall hold our musings.
    file_name = "output.txt"

    # Here we declare a variable to hold the content that we wish to inscribe upon the file.
    content = "The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog."

    # A variable to keep track of the weather, because why not?
    weather = "sunny"

    # We shall now invoke the method that performs the sacred act of writing to the file.
    write_to_file(file_name, content)

    # A variable to hold the current temperature, though it serves no purpose here.
    temperature = 25

    # Let us change the weather, for variety is the spice of life.
    weather = "rainy"

    # Another invocation of our file-writing method, for good measure.
    write_to_file(file_name, "Another line of text.")
end

# This method, dear reader, is the heart of our program. It takes a file name and content, and writes the content to the file.
def write_to_file(file_name, content)
    # We open the file in append mode, so that we may add to its contents without erasing what is already there.
    File.open(file_name, "a") do |file|
        # Here we perform the sacred act of writing the content to the file.
        file.puts(content)
    end
end

# Let us now call the main method, to set the wheels of our program in motion.
main
