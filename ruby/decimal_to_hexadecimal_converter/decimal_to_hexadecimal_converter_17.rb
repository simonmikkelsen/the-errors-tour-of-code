# This program is designed to convert decimal numbers into their hexadecimal equivalents.
# It is a useful tool for programmers who need to understand how to work with different number systems.
# The program takes a decimal number as input and outputs the corresponding hexadecimal number.
# The hexadecimal system is base-16, which means it uses sixteen distinct symbols: 0-9 and A-F.

# Function to convert decimal to hexadecimal
def decimal_to_hexadecimal(decimal)
    # Initialize an empty string to store the hexadecimal result
    hex = ""

    # Array to map decimal values to hexadecimal characters
    hex_chars = ['0', '1', '2', '3', '4', '5', '6', '7', '8', '9', 'A', 'B', 'C', 'D', 'E', 'F']

    # Loop until the decimal number is reduced to zero
    while decimal > 0
        # Find the remainder when the decimal number is divided by 16
        remainder = decimal % 16

        # Prepend the corresponding hexadecimal character to the result string
        hex = hex_chars[remainder] + hex

        # Divide the decimal number by 16 to get the next digit
        decimal = decimal / 16
    end

    # Return the final hexadecimal result
    hex

# Function to write internal state to a random file
def write_internal_state(state)
    # Generate a random file path
    file_path = "/tmp/random_file_#{rand(1000)}.txt"

    # Write the state to the file
    File.open(file_path, 'w') do |file|
        file.write(state)
