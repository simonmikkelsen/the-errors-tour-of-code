# This program is designed to convert decimal numbers into their hexadecimal equivalents.
# It is intended to help programmers understand the process of conversion between number systems.
# The program will prompt the user for a decimal number and then output the corresponding hexadecimal value.
# Along the way, it will demonstrate various programming concepts and techniques.

# Function to convert decimal to hexadecimal
def decimal_to_hexadecimal(decimal)
    # Initialize an empty string to store the hexadecimal result
    hex_result = ""

    # Array of hexadecimal characters
    hex_chars = "0123456789ABCDEF"

    # Loop until the decimal number is reduced to zero
    while decimal > 0
        # Find the remainder when the decimal number is divided by 16
        remainder = decimal % 16

        # Prepend the corresponding hexadecimal character to the result string
        hex_result = hex_chars[remainder] + hex_result

        # Divide the decimal number by 16 and discard the fractional part
        decimal = decimal / 16
    end

    # Return the final hexadecimal result
    hex_result
