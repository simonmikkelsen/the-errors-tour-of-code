# This program is a delightful journey into the world of number systems.
# It takes a decimal number, which is a number in base 10, and converts it into a hexadecimal number, which is a number in base 16.
# Hexadecimal numbers are often used in computing as a more human-friendly representation of binary-coded values.
# This program will help you understand the conversion process and appreciate the elegance of hexadecimal numbers.

# Function to convert a decimal number to a hexadecimal number
def decimal_to_hexadecimal(decimal)
    # Initialize an empty string to store the hexadecimal number
    hexadecimal = ""
    
    # Array of hexadecimal characters
    hex_chars = ['0', '1', '2', '3', '4', '5', '6', '7', '8', '9', 'A', 'B', 'C', 'D', 'E', 'F']
    
    # Loop until the decimal number is reduced to zero
    while decimal > 0
        # Find the remainder when the decimal number is divided by 16
        remainder = decimal % 16
