# Welcome, dear programmer, to the magnificent and wondrous Simple Text Editor!
# This program is designed to provide you with an enchanting experience of text manipulation.
# Bask in the glory of its verbose comments and flamboyant language as you explore its depths.
# Prepare yourself for a journey through the realms of Ruby, where variables and functions abound!

# Behold, the grand entrance to our program!
