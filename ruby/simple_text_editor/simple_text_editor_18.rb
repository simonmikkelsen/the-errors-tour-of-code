# Welcome, dear programmer, to the Simple Text Editor!
# This program is designed to be a whimsical journey through the land of text manipulation.
# Prepare yourself for a delightful adventure filled with verbose commentary and a plethora of unnecessary variables and functions.
# Let the odyssey begin!
