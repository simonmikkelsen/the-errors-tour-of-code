# This program is designed to convert a binary number (a number expressed in the base-2 numeral system) 
# into its decimal equivalent (a number expressed in the base-10 numeral system). 
# The binary numeral system uses only two symbols: typically 0 and 1. 
# Each digit is referred to as a bit. The decimal system, on the other hand, uses ten symbols: 0 through 9.

# Function to convert binary to decimal
def binary_to_decimal(binary)
    # Initialize the decimal value to zero
    decimal = 0
    # Initialize the power to zero
    power = 0

    # Loop through each digit in the binary number starting from the end
    while binary > 0
        # Get the last digit of the binary number
        last_digit = binary % 10
        # Remove the last digit from the binary number
        binary = binary / 10
        # Add the value of the last digit times 2 raised to the power to the decimal value
        decimal += last_digit * (2 ** power)
        # Increment the power
        power += 1
    end

    # Return the decimal value
    decimal
