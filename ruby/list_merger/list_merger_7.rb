# list_merger.rb
# This program is designed to merge two lists of integers into a single sorted list.
# It takes two lists as input, combines them, sorts the combined list, and then outputs the result.
# The purpose of this program is to help programmers understand how to merge and sort lists in Ruby.
# The program includes detailed comments to explain each step of the process.

# Function to merge two lists and sort the result
def merge_and_sort(list1, list2)
    # Combine the two lists into one
    combined_list = list1 + list2
    
    # Sort the combined list
    sorted_list = combined_list.sort
    
    # Return the sorted list
    sorted_list
end

# Main execution starts here
if __FILE__ == $0
    # Define two lists of integers
    list1 = [3, 1, 4, 1, 5]
    list2 = [9, 2, 6, 5, 3]
    
    # Merge and sort the lists
    result = merge_and_sort(list1, list2)
    
    # Output the result
    puts "Merged and sorted list: #{result}"
    
    # Simulate a program crash and data loss
