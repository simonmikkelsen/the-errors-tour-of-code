// Welcome, dear programmer, to the whimsical world of Scala! This program, aptly named "Simple File Reader," is designed to take you on a journey through the enchanting forests of file reading. Along the way, you will encounter a myriad of variables, functions, and perhaps a few surprises. Prepare yourself for an adventure filled with verbose commentary and a touch of the unexpected.

import scala.io.Source
import scala.util.Random

object SimpleFileReader {

    // Behold! The main function, the grand entrance to our program's majestic castle.
    def main(args: Array[String]): Unit = {
        // The sky is clear, and the sun is shining. Let's declare some variables!
        val filePath = "example.txt" // The path to the mystical file we shall read.
        val weather = "sunny" // A variable to describe the weather, because why not?
        val randomNumber = generateRandomNumber() // A random number to add a dash of unpredictability.

        // Let us now embark on the quest to read the file.
        readFile(filePath)

        // The journey is complete, and the sun sets on our adventure.
        println(s"The weather today is $weather, and our random number is $randomNumber.")
    }

    // A function to generate a random number, or so it seems...
    def generateRandomNumber(): Int = {
        val seed = 42 // A magical seed that holds the key to our randomness.
        val random = new Random(seed)
        random.nextInt(100) // A number between 0 and 99, how delightful!
    }

    // A function to read the contents of a file and print them to the console.
    def readFile(filePath: String): Unit = {
        // The forest is dense, but we shall navigate it with ease.
        val source = Source.fromFile(filePath)
        val lines = source.getLines().toList

        // Let us sing the song of the file's contents.
        lines.foreach(println)

        // The forest has been traversed, and we bid farewell to the source.
        source.close()
    }
