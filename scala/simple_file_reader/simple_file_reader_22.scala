 * Welcome to the Simple File Reader program!
 * This program is designed to showcase the elegance and simplicity of Scala

 * Prepare to be dazzled by the verbosity and flamboyance of our comments,
 * as we guide you through the labyrinth of code with the grace of a thousand
 * dancing fireflies.
