// This program is called Lix Counter. It is designed to count the number of words in a given text and calculate the Lix readability index.
// The Lix readability index is a measure of how difficult a text is to read. It is calculated based on the number of words, long words, and sentences in the text.
// The program will read a text file, count the number of words, long words, and sentences, and then calculate the Lix index.
// The program is written in Scala and demonstrates various programming techniques and practices.
