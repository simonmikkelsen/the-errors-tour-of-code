/**
 * Lix Counter Program
 * 
 * This program is designed to count the number of words in a given text and calculate the Lix readability index.
 * The Lix readability index is a measure of how difficult a text is to read. It is based on the number of words,
 * the number of long words (more than 6 letters), and the number of sentences in the text.
 * 
 * The program reads a text file, processes the text to count the words, long words, and sentences, and then
 * calculates and prints the Lix index.
