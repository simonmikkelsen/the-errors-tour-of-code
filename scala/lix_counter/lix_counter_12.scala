/**
 * Lix Counter Program
 * 
 * This program is designed to count the number of words in a given text and calculate the Lix readability index.
 * The Lix readability index is a measure of how difficult a text is to read. It is commonly used in educational settings
 * to assess the readability of textbooks and other educational materials. The Lix index is calculated based on the number
 * of words, the number of long words (words with more than 6 letters), and the number of sentences in the text.
 * 
 * The program reads a text file, processes the text to count the number of words, long words, and sentences, and then
 * calculates the Lix index. The result is printed to the console.
