/**
 * Welcome to the Simple Text Editor, a delightful Scala program designed to
 * enchant and educate aspiring programmers. This program is a whimsical journey
 * through the realms of text manipulation, where we shall explore the art of
 * editing text with the grace of a poet and the precision of a clockmaker.
 * Prepare to be dazzled by the verbosity of our comments and the elegance of our code.
