// This program is a safe file deleter. It is designed to delete files safely and securely.
// The program will take a file path as input and delete the file if it exists.
// It will also log the deletion process for auditing purposes.
// This program is written in Scala and demonstrates various programming techniques.
// Let's get started with the imports.
