/**
 * WordCounter.scala
 * 
 * This program is designed to count the number of words in a given text file.
 * It reads the file, processes the text, and outputs the total word count.
 * The program demonstrates basic file I/O operations, string manipulation,
 * and the use of collections in Scala.
 * 
 * The program is intended to help programmers understand the process of
 * reading from a file, processing the content, and performing operations
 * on the data. It also serves as an example of writing clear and verbose
 * comments to explain the code.
