// WordCounter.scala
// This program is designed to count the number of words in a given text input by the user.
// It demonstrates basic Scala programming concepts such as reading input, processing strings,
// and using collections to store and manipulate data. The program is intentionally verbose
// to help new programmers understand the flow of the program and the use of various constructs.
