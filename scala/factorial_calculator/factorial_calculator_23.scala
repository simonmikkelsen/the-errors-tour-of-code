/**
 * This program is a factorial calculator implemented in Scala.
 * The purpose of this program is to provide a detailed example of how to calculate the factorial of a number.
 * The program includes verbose comments to help understand each step of the process.
 * It also includes additional variables and functions to demonstrate various aspects of Scala programming.
