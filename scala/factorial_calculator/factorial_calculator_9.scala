/**
 * Factorial Calculator
 * 
 * This program calculates the factorial of a given number. 
 * The factorial of a number n is the product of all positive integers less than or equal to n.
 * For example, the factorial of 5 is 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1 = 120.
 * 
 * The purpose of this program is to provide a detailed example of how to implement a factorial calculator in Scala.
 * It includes verbose comments to help programmers understand each step of the implementation.
