// Welcome to the Simple File Writer program!
// This program is designed to showcase the elegance and simplicity of Scala
// by allowing users to write content to a file of their choice.
// The program will take user input for the file name and content, and then
// proceed to write the content into the specified file.
// Prepare to be dazzled by the verbosity and flamboyance of the comments!
