 * Welcome, dear programmer, to the illustrious and grandiose world of Scala!
 * This program, aptly named "simple file writer," is designed to take you on a
 * whimsical journey through the enchanting forests of code. As you traverse
 * this landscape, you will encounter a plethora of variables and functions,
 * each with its own unique charm and purpose. Prepare yourself for an adventure
