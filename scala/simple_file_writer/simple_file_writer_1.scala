 * Welcome, dear programmer, to the magnificent and illustrious Simple File Writer!
 * This program, crafted with the utmost care and attention to detail, is designed to
 * demonstrate the art of writing to a file in Scala. Prepare yourself for a journey
 * through the realms of verbosity and complexity, where every line of code is a
 * testament to the grandeur of programming.
